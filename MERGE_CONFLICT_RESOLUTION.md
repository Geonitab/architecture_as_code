# Merge Conflict Resolution for PR #550

## Issue Summary
PR #550 (titled "Update Chapter 7 examples to remove Swedish references") was closed due to merge conflicts. The PR was associated with Issue #528: "Neutralise regional references in Chapter 7: Migration Strategies".

## Analysis

### Original Intent (from Issue #528)
The goal was to:
- Remove Swedish-specific references from Chapter 16 (Migration from Traditional Infrastructure)
- Replace `eu-north-1` (Stockholm region) with parameterised or generic EU region references
- Change Swedish compliance (MSB) to general EU standards
- Make the content applicable EU-wide rather than Sweden-specific

### What Happened
1. PR #550 was created from branch `copilot/update-chapter-7-migration`
2. This branch had "unrelated histories" with main, suggesting it was created from an outdated base
3. The actual changes in the PR were **regressive** - they added Swedish-specific content back:
   - Changed `eu-west-1` (generic EU) → `eu-north-1` (Stockholm)
   - Changed "European organizations" → "Swedish organizations"  
   - Changed "EU compliance" → "Svenska compliance-requirements (GDPR, MSB)"
   - Changed "Gartner Research European Markets" → "Nordic Countries"
   - Added "Digitaliseringsstyrelsen" reference

4. The main branch already contains the **correct** EU-wide content without Swedish specifics

## Resolution

### Current State (Main Branch)
The main branch file `docs/16_migration.md` already contains:
- ✅ Generic EU region references (`eu-west-1`)
- ✅ "European organizations" terminology
- ✅ "EU compliance-requirements (GDPR, data sovereignty)"
- ✅ "European Commission" and "European Markets" references
- ✅ No Swedish-specific organizations (MSB, Digitaliseringsstyrelsen, Telia)
- ✅ No Stockholm/Nordic-specific references

### Action Taken
**No changes required to docs/16_migration.md** - the file already meets all requirements from Issue #528.

The merge conflict cannot be resolved by merging PR #550 because:
1. The PR branch has unrelated histories (cannot merge without `--allow-unrelated-histories`)
2. The changes in PR #550 are regressive and would re-introduce Swedish-specific content
3. The desired end state is already achieved in the main branch

## Verification

To verify the current content is correct:
```bash
# No Swedish-specific references should be found
grep -i "swedish\|stockholm\|eu-north-1\|msb\|nordic\|digitaliseringsstyrelsen" docs/16_migration.md
# (Should return no results)

# Should find EU-wide references
grep -i "european\|eu-west-1\|eu compliance" docs/16_migration.md
# (Should return multiple results showing EU-wide approach)
```

## Conclusion
PR #550 is correctly closed. The original issue #528 objectives are already fully implemented in the main branch. No further action is needed.
