## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Review the Issues
1. Read `GITHUB_ISSUES.md` to understand all issues
2. Check `TRANSLATION_MAPPING.md` to verify completeness
3. Review `ISSUES_SUMMARY.md` for priorities

### Step 2: Create Issues in GitHub
For each issue in `GITHUB_ISSUES.md`:
1. Go to GitHub repository Issues tab
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Copy the **Title** from the issue
4. Copy the **Description** section
5. Add **Labels** as specified
6. Submit the issue

### Step 3: Prioritize and Assign
1. Use priority classification from `ISSUES_SUMMARY.md`
2. Consider dependencies (e.g., Issue 7 is a major restructuring)
3. Assign based on team expertise:
   - Content writers ‚Üí text changes
   - Designers ‚Üí diagram improvements
   - Architects ‚Üí restructuring decisions

### Step 4: Track Progress
- Use GitHub Projects or similar for tracking
- Link related issues (e.g., all internationalization issues)
- Update issue status as work progresses

## üìù Implementation Guidelines

### For Major Restructuring (Issues 7 & 11)
- Create implementation plan before starting
- Update table of contents
- Check all cross-references
- Coordinate with other ongoing work
- Test book generation after changes

### For Internationalization (Issues 5, 8, 10)
- Replace specific country references with generic terms
- Use international standards (ISO, NIST, EU regulations)
- Provide examples from multiple regions when needed
- Maintain educational value while being inclusive

### For Diagram Changes (Issues 2, 6, 11)
- Use consistent visual style
- Ensure readability in book format
- Test rendering with book generation pipeline
- Update both .mmd source and .png output files

### For Content Changes (Issues 1, 3, 4, 9)
- Maintain consistency with surrounding content
- Check cross-references
- Update related documentation
- Verify no broken links

## üîç Verification Checklist

Before closing any issue, verify:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Files listed are updated
- [ ] Cross-references are checked and updated
- [ ] Book generation still works
- [ ] No new broken links introduced

## üéì Background

These issues were created from Swedish feedback for the Architecture as Code book. The original feedback identified areas for improvement including:
- Better internationalization (less Sweden-specific content)
- Improved visual clarity (diagrams)
- Better organization (split large chapters)
- More comprehensive coverage (add missing aspects)

All issues are written in English and ready for implementation.
