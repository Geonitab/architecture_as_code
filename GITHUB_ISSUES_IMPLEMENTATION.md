# GitHub Issues Creation - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation creates 16 GitHub issue markdown files based on the problem statement requirements. These files can be automatically converted into actual GitHub issues using the existing workflow infrastructure.

## Issue Categories

### Technical and Formatting Issues (6 issues)

1. **Pandoc outputs Swedish word for "Chapter"**
   - Issue with language configuration in Pandoc
   - Affects consistency of English language output
   - Solution: Update `docs/pandoc.yaml` language settings

2. **Incorrect figure caption rendering in Figure 21.1**
   - Caption shows: "Figur 21.1: Figure 24.1 – Maturity journey..."
   - Appears to be a merge/duplication error
   - Needs investigation in `docs/21_digitalization.md`

3. **Hardcoded heading numbering in Chapter 18**
   - Manual section numbers conflict with Pandoc auto-numbering
   - Creates incorrect headings like "18.1 20.1 Multi-Agent Operating Model"
   - Solution: Remove hardcoded numbers, let Pandoc handle it

4. **Figure 22.1 not rendering**
   - Figure reference exists but image doesn't render
   - Could be missing source file, conversion issue, or path problem
   - Requires investigation of source files and build process

5. **Missing consistent Mermaid theme across diagrams**
   - No unified visual theme for diagrams
   - Need consistent blue color range
   - Must be accessible for color-blind users

6. **Rework the title pages from scratch in British English**
   - Current pages mix Swedish/English content
   - Incorrect authorship attribution
   - Design doesn't cover full page
   - Complete rewrite needed

### Translation Tasks (10 issues)

Issues 7-16 cover translation of Chapters 1-10 from Swedish to British English:

- Each maintains the same structure and requirements
- Output format: `docs/[chapter_name]_en.md`
- Swedish originals remain unchanged
- Follows existing translation patterns in `TRANSLATION_PROJECT.md`

## How to Create the Issues on GitHub

### Method 1: Using GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Go to the **Actions** tab
3. Select the workflow **"Create GitHub Issues from Markdown"**
4. Click **"Run workflow"**
5. Select the branch with these changes
6. Click the green **"Run workflow"** button
7. Wait for completion (should take <1 minute)

### Method 2: Manual Verification (Dry Run)

Before creating the actual issues, you can verify they parse correctly:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/architecture_as_code/architecture_as_code

python3 -c "
import os

issues_directory = 'issues'

for filename in sorted(os.listdir(issues_directory)):
    if filename.endswith('.md') and filename != 'README.md':
        with open(os.path.join(issues_directory, filename), 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            lines = file.readlines()
            title = lines[0].strip()
            body_preview = ''.join(lines[1:5]).strip()
            print(f'Issue: {title}')
            print(f'Preview: {body_preview[:100]}...')
            print()
"
```

## File Format

Each issue file follows this format:

```markdown
Issue Title (First Line)

Issue body content starts here...
Can include:
- **Markdown formatting**
- Bullet points
- Code blocks
- etc.
```

The existing script at `.github/scripts/create_issues.py`:
- Reads all `.md` files from the `issues/` directory
- Uses line 1 as the issue title
- Uses remaining lines as the issue body
- Creates issues via GitHub API

## Infrastructure Used

This implementation leverages existing repository infrastructure:

1. **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/create-issues.yml`
   - Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)
   - Runs on ubuntu-latest
   - Uses Python 3.x with requests library

2. **Script**: `.github/scripts/create_issues.py`
   - Reads markdown files from `issues/` directory
   - Creates GitHub issues via API
   - Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `REPO` environment variables

## Post-Creation Actions

After the issues are created on GitHub, consider:

1. **Label the issues** appropriately:
   - `documentation` for translation tasks
   - `bug` for technical issues
   - `enhancement` for improvements

2. **Assign issues** to team members

3. **Add to project board** if applicable

4. **Archive or delete** the `issues/` directory to prevent duplicate creation

## Validation

All issue files have been validated:
- ✅ Correct file format (title on line 1, body following)
- ✅ Proper markdown formatting
- ✅ Complete information from problem statement
- ✅ Consistent structure across all files
- ✅ Detailed descriptions with context and suggested fixes
- ✅ Total of 16 issues created (6 technical + 10 translation tasks)

## Notes

- **No duplicate issues**: Running the workflow multiple times will create duplicate issues. Only run it once, then archive this directory.
- **Authentication**: The workflow uses `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` which is automatically provided by GitHub Actions.
- **Permissions**: The token needs write access to issues, which is standard for repository workflows.

## Implementation Details
