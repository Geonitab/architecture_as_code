# Chapter 25 Platform Engineering Neutralization - Summary

## Issue
**#022: Neutralise platform engineering in Chapter 25: Future Trends**

## Objective
Update Chapter 25 platform engineering implementation to provide EU-compliant stacks without Swedish localisation.

## Work Completed

### 1. Investigation and Verification (✅ Complete)
- Analyzed current Chapter 25 file (`docs/25_future_trends_development.md`)
- Reviewed archived version (`docs/archive/25_future_trends.md`)
- Identified that active version was already neutralized
- No Swedish-specific code or API examples found in current version

### 2. Changes Made

#### Chapter 25: Platform Engineering Section
**Status**: Already neutralized - no changes required

The Platform Engineering section contains only conceptual content:
- No code examples
- No API payloads or responses
- No Swedish-specific terminology
- EU-applicable guidance only

#### Chapter 2: Fundamental Principles
**Change**: Updated YAML metadata example
```yaml
# Before
name: swedish-security-requirements

# After  
name: eu-security-requirements
```

This ensures consistency across all compliance examples in the book.

### 3. Documentation Updates

Created/Updated:
1. **CHAPTER_25_VERIFICATION.md** - Comprehensive verification document
2. **Issues/022-neutralise-platform-engineering-ch25.md** - Updated with completion notes
3. **This summary document**

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **All criteria met:**

1. **API payloads and responses use European terminology only**
   - Current chapter has no API code examples
   - Archived examples with `swedish_compliance_status` removed in previous work

2. **All references to Swedish compliance statuses removed**
   - No `swedish_compliance_status` or similar fields present
   - Generic compliance terms used (GDPR, ISO27001)

3. **Platform engineering guidance supports EU-wide deployment**
   - Content is geography-agnostic
   - References apply to all European organisations
   - No country-specific examples or localization

## Archived Content Comparison

The archived version previously contained:
- ❌ `swedish_compliance_status` API field
- ❌ `swedish-alb` Terraform module references
- ❌ Swedish business hours optimization code
- ❌ Swedish holiday calendar implementations
- ❌ Cost metrics in SEK

All removed from current active version.

## Files Modified

1. `/docs/02_fundamental_principles.md` - Updated to eu-security-requirements
2. `/Issues/022-neutralise-platform-engineering-ch25.md` - Marked tasks complete
3. `/CHAPTER_25_VERIFICATION.md` - New verification document

## Verification

**No Swedish platform engineering localization found in:**
- ✅ Chapter 25 content
- ✅ Platform Engineering section
- ✅ Financial compliance references
- ✅ Any active documentation files

## Recommendations for Future

When adding platform engineering code examples:
1. Use generic EU naming conventions
2. Reference EU-wide standards (PSD2, GDPR, eIDAS)
3. Avoid country-specific fields or metrics
4. Use EUR for cost examples instead of national currencies
5. Keep examples applicable across all EU member states

## Conclusion

**Issue #022 is COMPLETE**. Chapter 25 platform engineering content has been verified as neutralized and EU-compliant. All acceptance criteria are met, and the chapter provides guidance applicable across European organisations without Swedish-specific implementation details.
