```

### PR #593 Analysis

**Why PR #593 was closed**:
1. PR #593 attempted to change "colour" → "color" (incorrect direction)
2. This would have reverted the proper British English conversion
3. PR was correctly closed to prevent regression

**Correct State**:
- Main branch: ✅ Uses "colour" (British) - CORRECT
- PR #593 branch: ❌ Attempted to use "color" (American) - INCORRECT

## Conclusion

Issue #574 has been fully resolved. All documentation, including the "Styling and Themes" section specifically mentioned in the issue, now uses British English spelling consistently.

No further action required.
