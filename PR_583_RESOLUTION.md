### Challenge 5 Section Verification

Lines 1005-1043 contain the "Challenge 5: Diagram Aesthetics" section referenced in issue #562:

```structurizr
views {
    styles {
        element "Person" {
            shape person
            background #FF6B35  # Brand colour
            colour #FFFFFF
            fontSize 24
        }
        
        element "Container" {
            background #004E89  # Brand colour
            colour #FFFFFF
            fontSize 18
            shape roundedbox
        }
        
        element "Database" {
            shape cylinder
            background #1A1A2E  # Brand colour
        }
        
        relationship "Relationship" {
            thickness 3
            colour #004E89
            routing curved  # or: orthogonal, direct
            fontSize 14
        }
    }
}
```

**All instances use "colour" (British spelling)**

## Conclusion

### Why PR #583 Had No Changes

The file was already in the correct state with British English spelling throughout. The agent that created PR #583 correctly identified that no changes were needed, but still created an empty commit.

### Resolution

âœ… **Issue #562 is ALREADY RESOLVED** - The file contains only British English spelling.

No code changes are required. The work described in issue #562 was complete from the beginning, likely when the file was first created.

### Recommendations

1. **Close Issue #562** as already completed
2. **No further action needed** on the code itself
3. Consider reviewing the process that generated issue #562 to prevent similar false positives
