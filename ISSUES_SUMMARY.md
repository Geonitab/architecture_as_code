      - Policy as Code
      - Risk Assessment

## Priority Classification

### High Priority (Major Restructuring)
- **Issue 7**: Split Automation chapter - affects book structure
- **Issue 11**: Split security mindmap - improves comprehension

### Medium Priority (Internationalization)
- **Issue 5**: Internationalize ADR chapter
- **Issue 8**: Internationalize Automation chapter
- **Issue 10**: Move and internationalize cost optimization

### Low Priority (Diagram Improvements)
- **Issue 2**: Vertical ADR lifecycle diagram
- **Issue 6**: Taller timeline diagram

### Quick Wins (Focused Content Changes)
- **Issue 1**: Add Management as Code to Introduction
- **Issue 3**: Replace Sweden-focused example
- **Issue 4**: Remove infrastructure/ prefix
- **Issue 9**: Remove Swedish testing framework

## Implementation Notes

### Major Restructuring Issues
Issues 7 and 11 require significant effort and coordination:
- Multiple new files need to be created
- Existing content needs to be reorganized
- Cross-references throughout the book need updating
- Table of contents needs updating

### Internationalization Strategy
Issues 3, 5, 8, and 10 all focus on removing Sweden-specific content:
- Replace "Swedish organizations" → "organizations"
- Replace Swedish regulations → international standards (EU GDPR, ISO, NIST)
- Replace SEK currency → generic cost examples
- Replace Stockholm region → generic cloud regions
- Remove Swedish authority references → use international equivalents

### Files Most Affected
- `docs/01_introduction.md` - Issue 1
- `docs/04_adr.md` - Issues 2, 3, 4, 5
- `docs/05_automation_devops_cicd.md` - Issues 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
- `docs/09_security.md` - Issue 11
- `docs/15_cost_optimization.md` - Issue 10
- Various diagram files (.mmd files)

## Next Steps

1. **Create Issues in GitHub**: Copy each issue from `GITHUB_ISSUES.md` into the GitHub issue tracker with appropriate labels

2. **Prioritize**: Determine which issues to tackle first based on:
   - Impact on book quality
   - Dependencies between issues
   - Available resources

3. **Assign**: Distribute issues to team members based on expertise:
   - Content writers for text changes
   - Designers for diagram improvements
   - Architects for restructuring decisions

4. **Track Progress**: Use GitHub Projects or similar to track issue completion

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Chapter Numbering**: If we split chapter 5 into multiple chapters, how should we renumber subsequent chapters?

2. **GDPR Focus**: Should the new GDPR chapter cover only GDPR, or expand to cover other data protection frameworks (CCPA, etc.)?

3. **Testing Framework**: For Issue 9, should we replace the Swedish framework section with international alternatives, or just remove it?

4. **Mindmap Detail**: For Issue 11, what level of detail should each of the four detailed mindmaps contain?
