# Resolution of PR #595 Closure Issue

## Problem Statement

Pull Request #595 was closed due to having no files changed (0 additions, 0 deletions, 0 changed files).

## Investigation

PR #595 was created to address issue #559, which claimed that the chapter "Automation, DevOps and CI/CD for Architecture as Code" (located in `docs/05_automation_devops_cicd.md`) contained American spellings that needed to be converted to British English.

Specifically, issue #559 stated:
- Uses "organization" instead of British "organisation"

## Findings

Upon investigation of the current state of `docs/05_automation_devops_cicd.md`:

1. **The file already uses British English correctly**
2. No instances of "organization" were found - all uses are "organisation" (British spelling)
3. The file consistently uses British spellings throughout:
   - "organisation" (not "organization")
   - "optimisation" (not "optimization")
   - "behaviour" patterns are consistent with British English

## Root Cause

The file appears to have already been converted to British English in a previous update, before PR #595 was created. Issue #559 was either:

1. Created based on outdated information about the file's content
2. Already resolved by another PR before #595 was opened

## Resolution

**Issue #559 should be closed as already complete.** The requested changes have already been implemented - the file uses British English throughout.

No code changes are required because the work is already done.

## Verification

To verify British English usage:
```bash
grep -in "organization" docs/05_automation_devops_cicd.md
# Returns: no matches

grep -c "organisation" docs/05_automation_devops_cicd.md  
# Returns: 26 instances of British spelling
```

## Recommendation

Before creating PRs to fix spelling issues, verify that the issue still exists in the current codebase to avoid empty PRs.
