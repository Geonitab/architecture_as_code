# Requirements Specification for "Architecture as Code"

## Overview
This document defines the content, quality and delivery requirements for the book "Architecture as Code". The goal is to produce a comprehensive, production-ready manuscript that explains how to document and automate modern software architecture using code. The specification covers the intended audience, chapter plan, writing standards, file system expectations and supporting automation so that contributors can deliver consistent results.

## Target Audience
### Primary Readers
- **System Architects (5–15 years experience)** – need to understand how classical architectural principles translate into code-driven workflows.
- **DevOps Engineers (3–10 years experience)** – want to extend infrastructure automation into holistic architecture automation.
- **Software Developers (3–12 years experience)** – seek architectural decision-making skills beyond implementation details.
- **Project Managers (5–15 years experience)** – require a technical view of architecture as code to lead transformation projects.
- **IT Managers (8–20 years experience)** – evaluate strategic benefits and organisational implications of codified architecture.

### Secondary Readers
- Technical consultants implementing customer solutions.
- Advanced students in computer science or software engineering programmes.
- Product owners responsible for technically complex products.
- Security specialists who need to understand automation guardrails.

### Prerequisites
Readers should understand cloud platforms (AWS, Azure or GCP), be comfortable with Git, know at least one programming language, understand CI/CD concepts and possess basic Unix/Linux proficiency.

## Core Themes
### Primary Theme
**Architecture as Code** – the practice of describing, versioning and automating complete system architecture through machine-readable artefacts that cover infrastructure, applications, data flows, security policies and organisational processes.

### Special Chapter Requirements
- **Glossary (`23_glossary.md`)** – no diagrams or sources required.
- **About the Authors (`24_about_the_authors.md`)** – no diagrams or sources required.
- **Conclusion (`22_conclusion.md`)** – does not require diagrams but must cite sources.
- **Appendix A (`26_appendix_code_examples.md`)** – diagrams are required; sources are optional.
- **Technical Architecture (`27_technical_architecture.md`)** – diagrams are required; sources are optional.
- **Future Development (`25_future_development.md`)** – sources are required; diagrams are optional.
- **Book Cover (`BOOK_COVER_DESIGN.md`)** – no diagrams or sources required.
- **EPUB Validation (`EPUB_VALIDATION.md`)** – no diagrams or sources required.

## Content Structure Requirements
- Every chapter must begin with an H1 heading (`# Title`).
- Include at least one diagram reference using the pattern `![...](images/diagram_<chapter>_<name>.png)`.
- Provide a clearly labelled "Sources" or "References" section.
- Minimum body length: 500 characters excluding whitespace.
- Minimum word count: 2,000 words, excluding formatting and code blocks.
- Maximum title length: 80 characters.

## Quality Standards
### Clarity
- At least three paragraphs per chapter.
- Maximum sentence length: 150 characters to support readability.
- Provide at least two H2 sections per chapter.

### Consistency
- Follow heading hierarchy: H1 > H2 > H3 > H4.
- Use consistent terminology for recurring concepts and technology names.

### Technical Accuracy
- Validate all code blocks.
- Ensure every diagram reference resolves to an existing image.
- YAML examples must parse successfully.
- External link checking is optional but encouraged.

## File System Expectations
- Store chapters in the `docs/` directory using the `.md` extension.
- Store diagram assets in `docs/images/` using the naming scheme `diagram_<chapter>_<name>.png`.
- Mermaid source files use the `.mmd` extension.

## Testing and Automation
- Automated checks fail when chapters are missing or incorrectly formatted.
- Clarity, technical accuracy and consistency checks provide warnings unless otherwise specified.
- Generate markdown reports in `test-reports/`.
- Contributors should integrate requirements into CI/CD pipelines so that pull requests surface documentation issues early.

## Version Control and Collaboration Guidelines
- Track requirements and chapter content in Git to maintain a full history of changes.
- Use pull requests for peer review, focusing on accuracy, completeness and alignment with this specification.
- Document architecture decisions using ADRs to explain rationale for major structural or tooling choices.

## Delivery Expectations
- Each chapter submission must include diagrams, code samples and references that meet the standards above.
- Final delivery includes a validated EPUB and supporting artefacts defined in the special chapter requirements.
- Ensure the manuscript remains cohesive by keeping terminology, formatting and narrative style consistent across all chapters.
