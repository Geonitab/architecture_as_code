# PR 546 GDPR Generalisation Fix

## Context
- **Issue #622** reported that PR #546 ("Generalise GDPR examples in Chapter 5: CI/CD Pipelines") was closed due to merge conflicts.
- **Issue #683** noted that the automated follow-up PR #661 contained no file changes and therefore did not resolve the conflicts.
- The unresolved content left Swedish phrasing, SEK-specific references, and EU North (Stockholm) defaults in the Chapter 5 appendix examples.

## Actions Taken
1. **Monitoring Guidance Update**
   - Clarified that monitoring guidance in `docs/05_automation_devops_cicd.md` now references EUR budgeting and the `eu-west-1` AWS region to reflect the intended general European examples.

2. **Appendix Code Example Rewrites**
   - Localised Swedish comments, log output, and error messages to clear British English in `docs/30_appendix_code_examples.md`.
   - Standardised terminology ("organisation", "cost centre", "analysis") and aligned spelling with the repository's British English requirement.
   - Switched all regional defaults from `eu-north-1` to `eu-west-1`, including Terraform back-end configuration, AWS SDK sessions, and residency checks.
   - Replaced Swedish stage descriptions and policy file names with neutral English equivalents (for example, `policies/eu-tagging.rego`).
   - Ensured budget automation steps report figures in EUR and produce English language cost reports.

3. **Terratest Alignment**
   - Updated the Terratest suite comments and assertions to describe GDPR checks in English, and validated that encryption keys, flow logs, tagging, and audit logging all use EU West settings.

## Result
- The manual adjustments reproduce the intent of PR #546 while rebasing cleanly on the current `main` branch.
- Issues #622 and #683 can now be resolved because the previously conflicting files have been reconciled and updated with the generalised GDPR examples.

## Validation
- Markdown files render without merge markers or untranslated Swedish phrasing in the affected sections.
- Terraform, Jenkins, and Terratest snippets reflect EU West defaults and British English language, matching the repository's style expectations.
