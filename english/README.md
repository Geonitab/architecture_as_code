## üìä Diagrams and illustrations

All diagrams are created with Mermaid and follow these guidelines:
- Maximum 5 elements per diagram
- Horizontal orientation (LR)
- Automatically converted to PNG in CI/CD

Example:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Infrastructure] --> B[as Code]
    B --> C[Automation]
    C --> D[Scalability]
    D --> E[Reliability]
```

## üîÑ Contributions and updates

### Workflow for changes:
1. Create branch for changes
2. Modify markdown files in `english/docs/`
3. Commit and push
4. GitHub Actions automatically builds PDF
5. Merge to main ‚Üí automatic release

### Chapter structure:
Each chapter follows the same structure:
- H1 main heading
- Diagram with description
- Introductory text (500 characters)
- Deep-dive sections
- Sources

## üèóÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflow (`build-book-en.yml`) handles:
- **Triggers**: Push/PR on markdown files
- **Dependencies**: Pandoc, TeXLive, Mermaid CLI
- **Build**: Converts diagrams + generates PDF
- **Artifacts**: Saves PDF for download
- **Releases**: Automatic versions on main branch
