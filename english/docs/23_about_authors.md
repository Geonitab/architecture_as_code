## Marcus Andersson - DevOps Engineer and Automation Specialist

Marcus Andersson brings a unique perspective to Infrastructure as Code through his deep experience in both development and operations. As a DevOps Engineer and Automation Specialist, he has been at the forefront of implementing IaC solutions in complex enterprise environments, bridging the gap between traditional IT operations and modern cloud-native practices.

### Professional background

With over 12 years in the industry, Marcus has evolved from a traditional system administrator to a DevOps practitioner who specializes in automation and infrastructure engineering. His hands-on experience spans the entire spectrum of infrastructure technologies, from legacy data centers to modern serverless architectures.

Marcus has led infrastructure automation initiatives at several major organizations, implementing CI/CD pipelines that handle thousands of deployments per month while maintaining strict security and compliance requirements. His practical approach to solving complex infrastructure challenges has made him a sought-after consultant and mentor.

### Areas of expertise

- **CI/CD pipeline design** and implementation across diverse technology stacks
- **Configuration management** with Ansible, Chef, and Puppet
- **Monitoring and observability** solutions for infrastructure and applications
- **Security automation** and compliance as code implementation
- **Migration strategies** from traditional to cloud-native infrastructure
- **Team coaching** and DevOps culture transformation

### Practical experience and teaching

Marcus combines deep technical expertise with strong communication skills, making complex infrastructure concepts accessible to practitioners at all levels. He has developed and delivered training programs on Infrastructure as Code for major technology companies and has mentored dozens of engineers in their DevOps transformation journeys.

His real-world experience troubleshooting infrastructure issues and optimizing deployment processes provides the practical foundation for many of the solutions and best practices presented in this book.

### Open source and community involvement

Both authors are active contributors to the Infrastructure as Code community, participating in open-source projects and sharing knowledge through conferences, workshops, and online resources. Their combined expertise spans the full lifecycle of infrastructure automation, from initial design through operation and optimization.

## Why this book was written

The motivation for writing this comprehensive guide stems from the authors' observation that while Infrastructure as Code has become essential for modern organizations, many practitioners lack access to comprehensive, practical guidance that bridges theory with real-world implementation.

Through their consulting work and community involvement, Anna and Marcus have seen organizations struggle with common challenges: choosing the right tools, designing scalable architectures, implementing security best practices, and managing the cultural changes required for successful IaC adoption.

This book represents their effort to distill years of practical experience into actionable guidance that helps organizations avoid common pitfalls and accelerate their Infrastructure as Code journey. Every pattern, practice, and recommendation has been tested in production environments and refined through experience with diverse organizational contexts.

## Acknowledgments

The authors wish to thank the many colleagues, clients, and community members who have contributed to their understanding of Infrastructure as Code through collaboration, feedback, and shared experiences. Special recognition goes to the open-source communities that have built the tools and practices that make modern infrastructure automation possible.

We also thank the technical reviewers who provided valuable feedback on early drafts, helping ensure that this book provides accurate, up-to-date, and practical guidance for practitioners at all levels.

Finally, we acknowledge the organizations that have trusted us to guide their infrastructure transformation journeys. Their willingness to embrace change and invest in modern practices has provided the real-world laboratory where many of these concepts were developed and refined.
