# Glossary

This glossary contains definitions of central terms used throughout the book.

**API (Application Programming Interface):** Interface that enables communication between different software components or systems through standardized protocols and data formats.

**Automation:** Process where manual tasks are performed automatically by computer systems without human intervention, increasing efficiency and reducing error risk.

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):** Development methodology that continuously integrates code changes and automates the deployment process for faster and safer deliveries.

**Cloud Computing:** Delivery of IT services such as servers, storage, and applications over the internet with on-demand access and pay-per-use models.

**Containers:** Lightweight virtualization technology that packages applications with all dependencies for portable execution across different environments and platforms.

**Declarative Programming:** Programming paradigm that describes the desired end result instead of specific steps to achieve it, enabling higher abstraction.

**DevOps:** Cultural and technical approach that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) for faster deliveries and improved collaboration between teams.

**Git:** Distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during development with support for branching and merging.

**Idempotency:** Property of operations that produce the same result regardless of how many times they are executed, critical for safe automation.

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Practice of managing infrastructure through code instead of manual processes, enabling version control and automation.

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** Text-based data format for structured information exchange between systems with human-readable syntax.

**Kubernetes:** Open-source container orchestration platform for automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**Microservices:** Architectural approach where applications are built as small, independent services that communicate via well-defined APIs.

**Monitoring:** Continuous observation of system performance, availability, and behavior to detect issues and ensure optimal operation.

**Orchestration:** Automated coordination and management of complex workflows, systems, and services across distributed environments.

**Policy as Code:** Practice of defining and enforcing organizational policies, security rules, and compliance requirements through code-based definitions.

**REST (Representational State Transfer):** Architectural style for designing web services that use standard HTTP methods for communication between systems.

**Scalability:** Ability of a system to handle increased load or demand by adding resources horizontally (more instances) or vertically (more power).

**Security by Design:** Approach that incorporates security considerations from the initial stages of system design rather than adding them retroactively.

**Terraform:** Infrastructure as Code tool developed by HashiCorp that enables declarative configuration of cloud resources across multiple providers.

**Version Control:** System that tracks and manages changes to files over time, enabling collaboration, history tracking, and rollback capabilities.

**YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language):** Human-readable data serialization standard commonly used for configuration files and data exchange.

**Blue-Green Deployment:** Deployment strategy that uses two identical production environments, allowing zero-downtime deployments by switching traffic between them.

**Canary Release:** Deployment technique that gradually rolls out changes to a small subset of users before full deployment, enabling early issue detection.

**Configuration Drift:** Divergence of actual system configuration from the intended or documented state, often caused by manual changes.

**GitOps:** Operational framework that uses Git repositories as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application configuration.

**Immutable Infrastructure:** Approach where infrastructure components are replaced rather than modified when changes are needed, ensuring consistency.

**Infrastructure Drift:** Unintended changes to infrastructure configuration that occur outside of the formal change management process.

**Load Balancer:** Device or software that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed.

**Multi-Cloud:** Strategy of using multiple cloud service providers to avoid vendor lock-in and increase redundancy and availability.

**Observability:** Practice of understanding system behavior and performance through metrics, logs, and traces to enable effective monitoring and troubleshooting.

**Pipeline:** Automated sequence of stages that code changes go through from development to production, including building, testing, and deployment.

**Provisioning:** Process of setting up and configuring infrastructure resources, including servers, networks, storage, and other components.

**Service Mesh:** Dedicated infrastructure layer for managing service-to-service communication in a microservices architecture.

**State Management:** Practice of tracking and maintaining the current configuration and status of infrastructure resources and their relationships.

**Template:** Reusable configuration pattern that defines infrastructure resources and their properties, enabling consistent deployments across environments.
