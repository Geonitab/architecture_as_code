# Architecture as Code - Book Project

This repository powers the publication workflow for the book *Architecture as Code*. It contains the complete manuscript alongside automation scripts for generating multi-format releases and distribution assets.

## 📚 About the Book

The book explores how to treat architecture and infrastructure work as software artefacts. Thirty-eight chapters, appendices, and structured templates are organised into Parts A–G with Part H delivering extended appendices that cover the entire lifecycle—from foundational principles and automation practices to organisational change and future outlooks. Each chapter is now framed for a global audience, combining conceptual guidance, practical templates, and illustrative diagrams without relying on region-specific assumptions.【F:docs/book_structure.md】【F:docs/part_a_foundations.md】【F:docs/part_h_appendices.md】

### Target Audience
- System and enterprise architects
- DevOps and platform engineers
- Software developers working with cloud-native stacks
- Technology leaders, managers, and programme owners
- Transformation teams driving digitalisation initiatives【F:docs/book_structure.md】

```

The canonical ordering of these chapters is published in `docs/book_index.json`, enabling automation and quality checks to consume a single, machine-readable source of truth.【F:docs/book_index.json】

## 🖼️ Diagram Workflow

Mermaid diagrams live in `docs/images/` with the source (`*.mmd`) and the rendered PNG committed together. Keeping both artefacts in version control ensures offline readers, document reviewers, and downstream automations can rely on stable diagrams without regenerating assets. The PNG files are marked as binary in `.gitattributes` so pull requests stay tidy even when large diagrams change.【F:.gitattributes†L1-L2】

When you adjust or add diagrams:

- Run `npm ci` once per workspace to install the locked Mermaid CLI toolchain.
- Execute `python3 scripts/check_mermaid_diagrams.py` to confirm every committed PNG still matches its Mermaid source. The helper renders each diagram using the same parameters as the book build and fails fast if an image is missing or outdated.【F:scripts/check_mermaid_diagrams.py†L1-L138】
- If the check reports that Chromium cannot start, install the headless browser dependencies listed in the error output or point `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` to an existing Chrome binary before rerunning the command.【F:scripts/check_mermaid_diagrams.py†L94-L138】

Continuous integration reinforces this policy via the **Verify Mermaid Diagrams** workflow, which installs the toolchain and runs the same check on every push or pull request that touches the diagram set.【F:.github/workflows/verify-mermaid-diagrams.yml†L1-L53】

## 🚀 Build and Automation Workflow

### Prerequisites
Canonical version pins live in the YAML front matter of `BOOK_REQUIREMENTS.md`. Install the accompanying manifests before running any build scripts:

- **Python 3.12.3** with the pip packages defined in `requirements.txt` (install via `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`).
- **Pandoc 3.1.9** and **XeLaTeX** (`texlive-xetex`, `texlive-fonts-recommended`, `texlive-plain-generic`).
- **Node.js 20.11.1** with the pinned Mermaid CLI (`npm ci` installs `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli@10.7.0` from `package-lock.json`).

Use `make verify-env` to confirm the local toolchain matches the locked versions and manifests. The check ensures `BOOK_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json` remain in sync.【F:BOOK_REQUIREMENTS.md†L1-L16】【F:requirements.txt†L1-L5】【F:package.json†L1-L12】【F:scripts/verify_environment.py†L1-L204】

### Core Commands
```bash
# Regenerate chapter content from automation scripts
python3 generate_book.py

# Build PDF, EPUB, and DOCX (runs diagram export, copies cover art, and writes to releases/book/)
docs/build_book.sh

# Generate the PowerPoint deck (writes to releases/presentation/ by default with --release)
python3 generate_presentation.py --release --create-pptx

# Orchestrate every deliverable and create an optional release archive
python3 build_all_orchestrator.py --zip

# Create the full distribution bundle (book formats, presentation, whitepapers, website)
./build_release.sh

```

> **Where is the build script?** The helper referenced above lives at `docs/build_book.sh`, is checked into source control, and ships with executable permissions so it can be invoked directly from the repository root (`./docs/build_book.sh`). The high-level orchestrator (`build_all_orchestrator.py`) calls the same entry point internally, keeping the README instructions and the automated workflow in lockstep.

The GitHub Actions pipeline (`.github/workflows/unified-build-release.yml`) mirrors these commands to produce release artifacts whenever book content or automation scripts change.【F:build_release.sh】

### MkDocs Documentation Site

The MkDocs configuration in `mkdocs.yml` publishes every chapter and appendix as a browsable documentation site. Use the standard MkDocs commands to iterate locally:

```bash
mkdocs serve   # start local preview server
mkdocs build   # render static site into the site/ directory
```

Continuous integration enforces successful builds through the `Build MkDocs Site` workflow, which runs whenever `docs/` sources or the MkDocs configuration change.【F:mkdocs.yml】【F:.github/workflows/build-mkdocs.yml】

## 🌐 Website

- **Public URL:** The documentation site is published at [https://aac.geon.se](https://aac.geon.se), matching the custom domain stored in the repository `CNAME` file to keep canonical links stable.【F:CNAME】【F:mkdocs.yml】
- **Deployment pipeline:** The `Build MkDocs Site` GitHub Actions workflow builds the site with `mkdocs build`, stages the generated artefacts (including `CNAME` and `.nojekyll`), and force-pushes the result to the `gh-pages` branch for GitHub Pages to serve.【F:.github/workflows/build-mkdocs.yml】
- **Local validation:** Run `mkdocs serve` for a preview or `mkdocs build` to recreate the static site locally before triggering a deployment, ensuring the hosted content mirrors the book manuscript.【F:mkdocs.yml】

## 📦 Release Deliverables
- **Book formats:** `architecture_as_code.pdf`, `.epub`, and `.docx` generated via Pandoc with the Eisvogel template.
- **Presentation materials:** `architecture_as_code_presentation.pptx` containing chapter summaries and speaker notes. The Python automation is the canonical source for the slide deck, and the retired Prezi prototype has been archived to avoid divergence.
- **Whitepapers:** HTML exports for each chapter designed for responsive reading.
- **Static website:** Production-ready site mirroring the manuscript for web distribution.【F:releases/README.md】

## 🔄 CI/CD Workflows

GitHub Actions automate validation and publishing. The primary pipeline (`unified-build-release.yml`) runs the full release script, while companion workflows handle targeted tasks such as diagram validation, content quality checks, automated code review, and issue triage.【F:build_release.sh】【F:.github/workflows/unified-build-release.yml】

Key workflows include:
- `unified-build-release.yml` – orchestrates book, presentation, whitepaper, and website builds, then prepares distribution assets.
- `verify-mermaid-diagrams.yml` – validates diagram consistency on every push or pull request.
- `content-validation.yml` – checks documentation quality and structural rules before merges.
- `validate-doc-numbering.yml` – confirms chapter numbering conventions remain consistent.
- `build-mkdocs.yml` – builds and deploys the documentation site to GitHub Pages.
- `claude.yml` – Claude Code agent that responds to issue comments and pull request review activity.
- `claude-code-review.yml` – automated code review on pull requests using Claude.
- `mermaid-designer-bot.yml` – responds to issues labelled `mermaid` or `diagram` to assist with diagram design.
- `issue-create-draft-pr.yml` – automatically creates or reuses a draft pull request when an issue is opened.
- `structurizr-diagrams.yml` – processes Structurizr diagram sources.
- `clean-fixed-issues.yml` and `clean-old-braches.yml` – housekeeping workflows for closing resolved issues and pruning stale branches.【F:.github/workflows/unified-build-release.yml】

## 📝 Contributing

1. Review `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md` alongside the unified Git workflow in
   `docs/documentation_workflow.md` to confirm spelling, tone, and review expectations.
2. Update the relevant markdown chapter(s) under `docs/`, ADR templates, or supporting
   automation scripts in line with the shared workflow.
3. Regenerate content and verify outputs:
   ```bash
   python3 generate_book.py
   docs/build_book.sh
   ```
4. When ADRs are added or updated, run:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/validate_adrs.py
   python3 scripts/generate_adr_catalogue.py
   ```
   These checks confirm the metadata links to chapters, diagrams, and backlog items whilst refreshing the MkDocs catalogue.
5. If changes affect release collateral, run `./build_release.sh` to confirm presentation, whitepaper, and website builds succeed.
6. Commit changes with clear messages and submit a pull request following the shared
   Git-based review workflow so automation validates heading and link conventions.

## ✍️ Editorial Style

- Use the official casing **Architecture as Code** in all narrative copy, diagrams, navigation labels, and commit messages unless quoting external material with different styling.
- Follow the full editorial rules in `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`, including British English spelling, tone guidance, and terminology guardrails.
- For presentation design, adhere to `docs/PRESENTATION_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md`, which defines modern visual standards, layout templates, accessibility requirements, and Kvadrat brand integration for all generated slide decks.
- Use `docs/PRESENTATION_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md` to validate presentations before distribution, ensuring compliance with design guidelines and accessibility standards.
- For whitepaper design, follow `docs/WHITEPAPER_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md`, which ensures professional formatting, WCAG AA accessibility compliance, responsive layouts, and consistent branding across all HTML whitepaper exports.

## 📚 Source Verification

Use `scripts/verify_sources.py` to verify all cited sources throughout the manuscript. The script checks URL accessibility, validates ISBN formats, and identifies sources requiring manual verification. It generates comprehensive Markdown and JSON reports listing verified, broken, and manually-verifiable sources.【F:scripts/verify_sources.py】

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_sources.py            # default run
python3 scripts/verify_sources.py --timeout 15  # custom timeout for slow endpoints
python3 scripts/verify_sources.py --output reports/sources  # custom output location
```

## 📄 Governance

The Architecture as Code book workshop maintains the repository, coordinates releases, and ensures automation reliability. See `docs/29_about_the_author.md` for author biography and book context.【F:docs/29_about_the_author.md】

## 🌍 Language

Manuscript chapters and automation output are maintained in English to streamline translation workflows and international collaboration.【F:docs/book_structure.md】【F:AGENTS.md】
