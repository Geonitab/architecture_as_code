## 🚀 Building the Book

### Prerequisites

**For PDF Generation:**
```bash
# Install Pandoc (3.1.9 or later)
wget https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/3.1.9/pandoc-3.1.9-1-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -in pandoc-3.1.9-1-amd64.deb

# Install LaTeX (for PDF generation)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y texlive-xetex texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-plain-generic

# Install Mermaid CLI (for diagram conversion)
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
```

**For Web Dashboard:**
```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
# Note: Requires --legacy-peer-deps due to @toast-ui/react-editor React 17 compatibility
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Known Security Issues:**
- The `markdown` package has a ReDoS vulnerability (GHSA-wx77-rp39-c6vg) with no fix available. The impact is minimal as it's only used for static content rendering.
- Some dependencies require `--legacy-peer-deps` due to React version compatibility. See [package.json](package.json) for details.

### Build Commands

**Generate Book Content:**
```bash
# Generate all markdown files
python3 generate_book.py

# Build PDF with diagrams
cd docs && ./build_book.sh
```

**Run Web Dashboard:**
```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
```

**Generate All Formats:**
```bash
# Complete release build
./build_release.sh
```

## 🎨 React Dashboard

The project includes a React-based web dashboard that provides:
- Book project status overview
- Chapter structure visualization
- CI/CD pipeline status
- Build artifacts and downloads

**Technologies:**
- React + TypeScript
- Vite (build tool)
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- React Router
- react-syntax-highlighter with Prism.js (code syntax highlighting)

**Code Syntax Highlighting:**

The book preview feature uses Prism.js via `react-syntax-highlighter` to provide syntax highlighting for code blocks with a dark theme (VS Code Dark+). Supported languages include:
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- YAML
- JSON
- Bash/Shell
- Dockerfile
- And many more...

Code blocks in markdown are automatically detected and highlighted based on the language identifier (e.g., ` ```yaml`, ` ```python`, ` ```javascript`).

## 🔄 CI/CD Workflows

All builds are automated through GitHub Actions:

### Unified Build & Release
Triggers on push to main branch or docs changes:
- Builds all book formats (PDF, EPUB, DOCX)
- Generates presentations
- Creates whitepapers
- Builds static website
- Creates GitHub release with all artifacts

### Individual Workflows
- `generate-whitepapers.yml` - Standalone whitepaper generation
- `generate-presentations.yml` - Standalone presentation generation
- `content-validation.yml` - Validates markdown and structure

## 📝 Contributing

To contribute to the book content:

1. Edit markdown files in `docs/` directory
2. Follow the existing structure and style
3. Test locally with `python3 generate_book.py && cd docs && ./build_book.sh`
4. Submit a pull request

## 🔍 Link Verification

The repository includes a comprehensive link verification tool to ensure all links in documentation are valid.

**Run link verification:**
```bash
python3 scripts/verify_links.py
```

This generates three reports:
- `link-verification-report.md` - Markdown summary
- `link-verification-report.html` - Interactive HTML report
- `link-verification-report.json` - Machine-readable JSON

**Advanced options:**
```bash
# Custom timeout for slow connections
python3 scripts/verify_links.py --timeout 20

# Verbose output
python3 scripts/verify_links.py --verbose

# Custom output location
python3 scripts/verify_links.py --output reports/links
```
