Hardcoded heading numbering in Chapter 18

**Description**: Chapter 18 has hardcoded numbering that results in incorrect headings such as:
```
18.1 20.1 Multi-Agent Operating Model
```

**Current Behavior**: The chapter contains manually entered section numbers that conflict with Pandoc's automatic numbering system, resulting in duplicate or incorrect numbering.

**Expected Behavior**: Section numbering should be dynamically generated by Pandoc to ensure consistency and correctness throughout the document.

**Affected Files**:
- `docs/18_team_structure.md`

**Suggested Fix**: 
1. Remove hardcoded section numbers from the markdown headers
2. Let Pandoc's `number-sections: true` configuration handle all numbering automatically
3. Verify the output after changes to ensure correct numbering
