# Balance Chapter 18

## Summary
Improve Chapter 18 by translating residual Swedish content, ensuring diagrams are present, and distributing code explanations evenly.

## Tasks
- [ ] Translate all Swedish prose into British English.
- [ ] Create the missing diagrams and ensure each is referenced in the text.
- [ ] Format all code snippets using fenced code blocks with correct language tags.
- [ ] Add introductory and concluding paragraphs around each code block describing its intent and outcome.
- [ ] Redistribute code examples so they are evenly spaced throughout the chapter with supporting visuals.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Chapter 18 is fully in British English and free from Swedish terminology.
- Each required diagram exists, renders correctly, and is referenced with explanatory prose.
- Code snippets appear as fenced code blocks and are preceded and followed by descriptive text.
- Code examples are distributed evenly across the chapter with complementary diagrams explaining their goals.
