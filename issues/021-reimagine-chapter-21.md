# Reimagine Chapter 21

## Summary
Transform Chapter 21 to remove Swedish-specific framing, update diagrams, and streamline the structure for clarity.

## Tasks
- [ ] Translate Chapter 21 into British English and remove references to Swedish organisations or policies.
- [ ] Create missing diagrams and ensure they adopt the agreed styling and vertical layout where necessary.
- [ ] Redesign Figure 21.2 as a vertically oriented mind map with simplified detail and accessible colours.
- [ ] Remove Sections 21.2.3 and 21.3, updating navigation and references accordingly.
- [ ] Provide explanatory prose for each diagram and ensure the chapter flows logically after restructuring.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All diagrams are present, use the approved styling, and are explicitly referenced in the text.
- Figure 21.2 appears as a readable vertical mind map with a neutral colour palette.
- Sections 21.2.3 and 21.3 are removed without leaving dangling references.
- Chapter narrative flows smoothly with appropriate context around each visual.
