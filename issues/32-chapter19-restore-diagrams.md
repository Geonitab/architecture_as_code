Restore missing diagrams in Chapter 19

**Description**: Several diagrams referenced in Chapter 19 fail to render in the published output. The placeholders remain, but the PNG files appear to be missing or outdated.

**Current Behavior**: Figure callouts show broken images or empty space where diagrams such as the MaC operating model and DevOps loop should appear.

**Expected Behavior**: All figures referenced in Chapter 19 should display the correct diagrams.

**Affected Files**:
- `docs/19_management_as_code.md`
- `docs/images/diagram_19_mac_operating_model.png`
- `docs/images/diagram_19_management_overview.png`
- `docs/images/diagram_19_devops_management_loop.png`
- `docs/images/diagram_19_governance_pipeline.png`
- `docs/images/diagram_19_github_management_flow.png`
- `docs/images/diagram_19_management_workflow.png`
- `docs/images/diagram_19_team_of_teams.png`

**Suggested Fix**:
1. Confirm whether the PNG assets were deleted or not regenerated.
2. Recreate any missing diagrams from their Mermaid sources.
3. Rebuild the book to verify that all figures appear as expected.
