Remove the awkward line break before “sharing reinforce professional growth.”

**Description**: A stray line break appears before the sentence fragment “sharing reinforce professional growth.” near the competency loop discussion, interrupting the flow of the paragraph.

**Current Behavior**: The rendered paragraph contains a newline before “sharing reinforce professional growth.”, causing the sentence to split unexpectedly in the PDF output.

**Expected Behavior**: The sentence should read smoothly as part of the preceding line without a forced break.

**Affected Files**:
- `docs/16_migration.md`
- `docs/18_team_structure.md` (where the text currently lives)

**Suggested Fix**:
1. Remove the extra newline or double space before the phrase so Pandoc does not insert a break.
2. Rebuild the chapter to ensure the paragraph renders on a single line.
