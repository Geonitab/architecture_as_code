Use tables to illustrate multi-dimensional comparisons

**Description**: Certain sections describe multi-dimensional frameworks (e.g., capability vs. maturity vs. ownership) but present the information only in prose. Tables would make these comparisons clearer.

**Current Behavior**: Readers must parse long paragraphs to understand how dimensions interact, increasing cognitive load.

**Expected Behavior**: Key frameworks should include tables that map dimensions against each other for quick reference.

**Affected Files**:
- `docs/**/*.md`

**Suggested Fix**:
1. Identify multi-dimensional concepts (e.g., governance vs. automation vs. enablement) and design tables to capture the relationships.
2. Insert the tables near the explanatory text.
3. Ensure the tables follow the repositoryâ€™s formatting standards and render correctly.
