# General Manuscript Modernisation

## Summary
Ensure the entire manuscript aligns with global guidance by removing Swedish-specific content, standardising presentation, and improving explanatory context across diagrams and code samples.

## Tasks
- [ ] Remove instructions and examples that rely on Swedish-specific assumptions or organisations throughout the manuscript.
- [ ] Confirm every heading begins with a capital letter and update any that do not.
- [ ] Verify all diagrams are generated successfully and referenced correctly in the surrounding prose.
- [ ] Relocate long code listings to the appendix and insert cross-references from the relevant chapters.
- [ ] Add explanatory paragraphs before and after each code snippet and small diagram to clarify intent and expected outcomes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All chapters are free from Sweden-specific references unless explicitly required for universal context.
- Headings consistently start with capital letters across the book.
- Each diagram renders correctly and has at least one textual reference in its chapter.
- Lengthy code blocks reside in appendices with clear forward references in the main chapters.
- Code snippets and diagrams are framed with descriptive prose that explains their purpose and results.
