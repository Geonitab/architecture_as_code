Remove Figure 24.1 and its caption

**Description**: Figure 24.1 is no longer needed in Chapter 24 and should be removed along with its caption to streamline the narrative.

**Current Behavior**: The chapter displays Figure 24.1 (the maturity journey diagram) even though the surrounding text now covers the topic without needing the visual.

**Expected Behavior**: Chapter 24 should begin directly with the narrative or the next relevant figure, omitting Figure 24.1 entirely.

**Affected Files**:
- `docs/24_best_practices.md`
- `docs/images/diagram_20_kapitel19.png`

**Suggested Fix**:
1. Delete the Markdown block that inserts Figure 24.1 and its caption.
2. Remove the PNG if no other chapters reference it.
3. Rebuild the book to confirm there are no broken references.
