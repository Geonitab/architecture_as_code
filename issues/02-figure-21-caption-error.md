Incorrect figure caption rendering in Figure 21.1

**Description**: The caption for Figure 21.1 is rendered incorrectly with what appears to be a merge or duplication error.

**Current Caption**: 
```
Figur 21.1: Figure 24.1 â€“ Maturity journey for Architecture as Code
```

**Expected Caption**: Should display a single, correct caption without duplication or reference to multiple figure numbers.

**Impact**: This creates confusion for readers and suggests content quality issues.

**Suggested Fix**: Review the source markdown file `docs/21_digitalization.md` to identify and correct the caption duplication or merge error.
