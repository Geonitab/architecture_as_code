Add tables throughout the book to improve data presentation

**Description**: The manuscript currently lacks tables, making it difficult to compare information side by side or summarise key dimensions succinctly.

**Current Behavior**: Chapters rely solely on prose and diagrams, leaving no tabular summaries for readers who prefer structured comparisons.

**Expected Behavior**: Each major section should include tables where appropriate to present frameworks, maturity levels, or capability matrices.

**Affected Files**:
- `docs/**/*.md`

**Suggested Fix**:
1. Identify chapters where lists or paragraphs could be converted into tables.
2. Add Markdown tables that align with the style guide.
3. Verify the tables render correctly in PDF and HTML outputs.
