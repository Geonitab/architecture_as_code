# Refresh Chapter 27

## Summary
Update Chapter 27 to ensure accurate terminology, British English prose, and a streamlined structure without unsupported visuals.

## Tasks
- [ ] Correct terminology to emphasise "Architecture as Code" rather than "Infrastructure as Code" where applicable.
- [ ] Translate all remaining content into British English.
- [ ] Remove Figure 27.1 and adjust surrounding text to reflect its absence.
- [ ] Delete Section 27.1.2 and update references accordingly.
- [ ] Fix Section 27.2.1 so that narrative content appears in the body rather than the heading.

- The chapter is fully written in British English with coherent prose.
- Figure 27.1 and Section 27.1.2 are removed without leaving broken references.
- Section 27.2.1 has a clean heading with explanatory text in the body.
