# PR #591 Resolution

## Issue Summary
- **PR Number**: #591
- **Title**: [WIP] Fix British English localization in ADR example
- **Related Issue**: #573
- **Status**: Closed (no files changed)

## Root Cause Analysis

Pull Request #591 was created to address issue #573, which requested changing "organization" (American English) to "organisation" (British English) in the ADR example file (`docs/04_adr.md`).

However, the PR was closed because it contained no file changes. Investigation reveals:

1. **The fix was already applied**: The main branch already contains "organisation" in British English
2. **No American English variants found**: A thorough search of `docs/04_adr.md` found zero instances of "organization"
3. **British English is properly used**: The file contains 7 instances of British English variants:
   - "organisation" (lines 11, 103, 250)
   - "organisational" (lines 204, 252)
   - "standardise" (line 103)
   - "standardised" (lines 30, 252)
   - "analyse" (line 5)

## Verification

```bash
# Check for American English variants (returns 0 results)
git show main:docs/04_adr.md | grep -i "organization"
git show main:docs/04_adr.md | grep -E "(organization|standardize|organize|optimize|realize|analyze|centralize)"

# Check for British English variants (returns 7 results)
git show main:docs/04_adr.md | grep -E "(organisation|standardise|organise|optimise|realise|analyse|centralise)"
```

## Resolution

**Issue #573 has already been resolved** in a previous commit. The ADR example file correctly uses British English throughout.

**Recommendation**: Issue #573 should be closed as already completed.

## Key Lines from docs/04_adr.md

Line 103 (the specific example mentioned in issue #573):
```
The organisation needs to standardise on an Architecture as Code tool
```

This confirms the British English localization requested in issue #573 is already implemented.
