**Priority:** Medium
**Suggested Labels:** documentation, localisation
**Linked Finding:** Search index review â€“ 17 October 2025

## Summary
Standardise the "Glossary" chapter with British English spellings and remove EU-exclusive framing that may confuse UK readers.

## Background
`docs/28_glossary/28_glossary.md` defines numerous terms for Architecture as Code yet includes American spellings such as "organizational" and frames concepts like "Data Sovereignty" primarily within GDPR contexts. These inconsistencies undermine the British English language requirement and risk over-emphasising EU regulatory viewpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Convert all American spellings to British English equivalents.
- [ ] Review entries for EU-specific references and adjust to clarify UK applicability or provide neutral definitions.
- [ ] Confirm that glossary cross-references and anchors remain accurate after updates.
- [ ] Ensure that any examples align with the revised terminology.

## Additional Notes
Coordinate glossary revisions with chapter authors so terminology remains consistent throughout the book.
