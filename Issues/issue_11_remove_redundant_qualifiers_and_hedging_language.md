# Issue 11: Remove Redundant Qualifiers and Hedging Language

## Relevant Documentation Sections
Architecture as Code manuscript chapters, README content, and supporting documentation files.

## Problem Statement
The documentation repeatedly uses hedging adverbs such as "often", "typically", and "particularly". These words weaken otherwise factual statements without adding verifiable nuance. The resulting prose sounds tentative, inflates the word count, and slows reading speed.

## Impact
- Readers perceive the guidance as uncertain or non-committal.
- Important statements become verbose, reducing clarity and engagement.
- Increased word count creates friction for teams attempting to reference the material quickly.

## Recommended Remediation
- Remove hedging qualifiers unless they convey measurable frequency or confidence levels.
- Recast sentences to deliver direct statements (for example, "Systems drift" instead of "Systems typically tend to drift").
- Review headings, bullet lists, and explanatory paragraphs for redundant qualifiers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Qualifiers remain only where they communicate data-backed frequency or probability.
- Updated passages read in clear, direct British English without unnecessary repetition.
- Editorial review confirms improved readability in at least the cited examples and other high-traffic sections.
