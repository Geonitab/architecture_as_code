# Issue: Complete Reference Chapter for Verified Sources

**Priority:** High  
**Suggested Labels:** documentation, qa  
**Linked Findings:** #1–#10 – Comprehensive Verification

## Summary
Confirm that the references chapter lists every source used in the verification effort and that cross-references throughout the book resolve correctly.

## Background
The documentation overhaul depends on 16 verified sources. To maintain traceability, `docs/33_references.md` must include each source in the agreed format, and internal citations throughout the chapters (including updated ones) must point back accurately.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review `docs/33_references.md` and confirm all 16 verified sources are present, correctly formatted, and alphabetically or logically ordered per repository standards.
- [ ] Check chapters touched by recent factual updates (e.g., `docs/01_introduction.md`, `docs/02_fundamental_principles.md`, `docs/06_structurizr.md`, and any other affected files) to ensure their reference links resolve to entries in `docs/33_references.md`.
- [ ] Add or correct anchors, link identifiers, or numbering so citations remain consistent after new content is integrated.
- [ ] Document any discrepancies or missing sources for follow-up if they cannot be resolved immediately.

## Additional Notes
Consider producing a short changelog within the issue comments to track reference updates once completed.
