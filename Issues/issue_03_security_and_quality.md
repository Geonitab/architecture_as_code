## Problem Statement
The security and automation chapters cite the governance and platform sources, yet the flow between policy decisions, Terraform state management, and automated testing remains implicit. Readers require a clearer bridge explaining how governance guidance translates into concrete state handling and continuous testing routines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Security chapters explicitly describe how the Thoughtworks governance guidance drives Terraform guardrails backed by HashiCorp and Microsoft Learn documentation.
- Testing chapters showcase Pulumi's testing patterns as a reference implementation for Architecture as Code pipelines.
- Source IDs [9]–[12] are referenced in context with consistent formatting and British English spelling.
- Updated copy clarifies how the guidance improves resilience and auditability without expanding chapter scope beyond agreed limits.
