# Mitigate Maintainability Risks in Chapter 07: Containerisation and Orchestration as Code

- Chapter 05 – Automation, DevOps and CI/CD for Architecture as Code

## Problem Statement
The containerisation chapter outlines orchestration pressures but omits how declarative boundaries are enforced through code review and automated checks. Examples highlight GDPR tagging and promotion drift, yet there is no reference to guard rails or testing routines that keep manifests tidy. Without that detail, maintainability guidance for platform teams remains thin.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Describe mechanisms for validating container manifests (schema validation, policy as code, integration tests) before deployment.
- [ ] Provide examples of automated drift detection between declared manifests and live clusters.
- [ ] Show how orchestration stacks integrate with CI/CD pipelines to maintain repeatable promotions.
- [ ] Reference the chosen sources in the strengthened material.
