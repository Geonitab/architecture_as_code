# Analyze Chapter Length Distribution

## Summary
Measure the length of every chapter and confirm that none exceed the allowed variance relative to the average chapter length.

## Tasks
- Calculate the average chapter length based on word or page counts.
- Compare each chapter against the average and highlight any that are more than 100% longer (over 2x the mean).
- Provide recommended edits or splits for any chapters breaching the threshold.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A report documents chapter lengths, the computed average, and variance results.
- No chapter remains more than 100% longer than the average length without an action plan.
