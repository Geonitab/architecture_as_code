## Relevant Manuscript Sections
- `01_introduction.md` – thread CNCF insights through the adoption narrative.
- `07_containerization.md` – highlight container adoption metrics cited by CNCF.
- `15_cost_optimization.md` – contextualise cost projections with Gartner data.
- `17_organizational_change.md` – reference both Gartner and HashiCorp surveys when describing change drivers.
- `27_conclusion.md` – echo the same research in the closing strategy guidance.
- `11_governance_as_code.md` – link governance recommendations to the Thoughtworks radar entry.

## Problem Statement
Trend and change chapters cite industry research yet present statistics without a cohesive storyline. Stakeholder feedback notes that readers cannot trace how survey results inform the governance recommendations. We need to show how cloud adoption metrics reinforce the organisational change roadmap and governance controls described in the book.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Chapters 1 and 7 integrate CNCF findings to explain container maturity alongside Architecture as Code adoption.
- Chapters 15 and 17 explicitly cite Gartner and HashiCorp data when discussing investment and change management priorities.
- Chapter 11 references the Thoughtworks Governance as Code radar item to justify automation guidance.
- Chapter 27 summarises these insights into a closing message that aligns with earlier citations, using British English spelling.
