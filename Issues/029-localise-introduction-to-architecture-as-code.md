# Localise Content to British English: Introduction to Architecture as Code

The chapter "Introduction to Architecture as Code" (located in section "Introduction to Architecture as Code" at 01_introduction/) introduces the core concepts of Architecture as Code, explaining how it enables organisations to apply software development methodologies across their technical landscape. However, it uses American English spellings.

Specific issue: The text employs "organizations" instead of the British "organisations".

Example excerpt: "This approach enables organizations to apply the same methodologies as traditional software development across their whole technical landscape."

This issue tracks the task to review and update the chapter to consistent British English, ensuring spellings like "organisations" are used throughout.
