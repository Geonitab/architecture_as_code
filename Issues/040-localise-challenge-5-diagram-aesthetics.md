# Localise Content to British English: Challenge 5: Diagram Aesthetics

The section "Challenge 5: Diagram Aesthetics" (located in 06_structurizr/#challenge-5-diagram-aesthetics) addresses diagram styling challenges. It includes American spellings.

Specific issue: Uses "color" instead of British "colour", repeated in the text.

Example excerpt: "element \"Person\" { shape person background #FF6B35 # Brand color color #FFFFFF fontSize 24 } ..."

This issue tracks updates to "colour" for British English.
