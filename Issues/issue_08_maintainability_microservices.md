## Source IDs

## Relevant Manuscript Sections
- Chapter 08 – Microservices Architecture as Code
- Chapter 11 – Governance as Code

## Problem Statement
Chapter 08 recognises the operational burden of distributed systems but lacks enforceable guard rails. There is little instruction on codifying governance, defining service contracts, or embedding policy rules that protect maintainability. The absence of automated stewardship patterns leaves teams exposed to dependency tangles and inconsistent service quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document policy-as-code techniques for maintaining service boundaries and compliance in microservice estates.
- [ ] Provide actionable guidance on cataloguing service contracts and monitoring coupling signals.
- [ ] Include examples of escalation paths or playbooks triggered when automated checks fail.
- [ ] Reference the supporting sources where the new recommendations appear.
