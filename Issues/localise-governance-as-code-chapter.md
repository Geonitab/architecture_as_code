# Issue: Localise "Governance as Code" to British English

**Priority:** High
**Suggested Labels:** documentation, localisation
**Linked Finding:** Search index review â€“ 17 October 2025

## Summary
Revise the "Governance as Code" chapter to apply British English spellings and contextualise governance terminology for UK organisations rather than EU-centric scenarios.

## Background
`docs/11_governance_as_code/11_governance_as_code.md` expands governance practices into code-driven workflows but leans on European compliance vocabulary and locales. Terms like "compliance requirements" are framed in a European setting, and audit trail examples reference non-British jurisdictions, leading to a mixed voice that can distract UK readers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify and convert all American spellings to British English across the chapter.
- [ ] Rebalance the narrative to emphasise UK governance and regulatory expectations, reducing purely EU-centric framing.
- [ ] Update examples of audit trails and compliance flows to include British use cases or neutral terminology.
- [ ] Confirm that linked sections and diagrams maintain coherence after the edits.

## Additional Notes
Collaborate with governance contributors to ensure that any EU references retained remain accurate and clearly positioned in relation to UK practices.
