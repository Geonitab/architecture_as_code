## Relevant Manuscript Sections
- 06_structurizr.md – modelling workflow guidance
- 11_governance_as_code.md – automation of policy guardrails
- 22_documentation_vs_architecture.md – docs-as-code interplay
- 24_best_practices.md – curated practices and patterns

## Problem Statement
Key modelling and governance chapters reference Structurizr, the C4 model, and docs-as-code practices. However, the narrative does not fully articulate how these sources operate together to maintain traceability from diagrams to policy. We need to highlight the combined workflow so readers understand how modelling assets and documentation stay synchronised.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Chapters 6, 11, 22, and 24 include explicit explanations of how Structurizr DSL, C4 modelling, and docs-as-code practices support continuous governance.
- Updated passages explain the role of GitLab guidance and evolutionary architecture principles when codifying architectural decisions.
- Source IDs [5]–[8] remain cited in the "Sources" lists with no formatting regressions.
- Examples reinforce British English spelling and terminology.
