## Problem Statement
Diagram automation chapters outline workflows but could better articulate why particular modelling approaches matter to Architecture as Code teams. The selected sources articulate standards, tooling characteristics, and industry context that should inform guidance for modelling consistency.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Introduce a comparative table or narrative that contrasts Structurizr, Mermaid, and CALM capabilities, referencing the cited material.
- Document at least one new best practice that demonstrates how C4 modelling conventions connect to Architecture as Code governance needs.
- Add a cross-link from the documentation versus architecture chapter that positions CALM as a harmonising meta-model.
- Ensure citations are added where tool-specific recommendations are made so that future automation work can reference the authoritative material.

## Recommended Labels
