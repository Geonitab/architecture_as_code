# Source Verification Issue Templates

These curated GitHub issue drafts ensure that key Architecture as Code sources remain represented within the manuscript narrative. Each template links back to the foundational references and highlights the manuscript areas that require updates.

- [issue_002_architecture_decision_alignment.md](issue_002_architecture_decision_alignment.md) – Reinforce ADR guidance with foundational workflows and literature.
- [issue_003_diagram_narrative_refresh.md](issue_003_diagram_narrative_refresh.md) – Update diagram automation chapters with current modelling references.
- [issue_004_devops_testing_sources.md](issue_004_devops_testing_sources.md) – Connect DevOps testing practices to single-source documentation guidance.

Each issue template is intended for the `documentation` label with optional `enhancement` scope depending on the planned work.
