# Curated Issue Catalogue

This directory contains pre-drafted GitHub Issues that align with the Architecture as Code roadmap. Each template references approved research sources and key chapters to accelerate backlog curation whilst preserving academic rigour.

## Available Issue Templates

- [issue_002_structurizr_enablement.md](issue_002_structurizr_enablement.md) — Strengthen Structurizr adoption and diagram governance.
- [issue_003_policy_alignment.md](issue_003_policy_alignment.md) — Harmonise policy as code practices across delivery platforms.

## Using the Templates

1. Copy the relevant markdown file into a new GitHub Issue, keeping the headings intact.
2. Tailor the problem statement and acceptance criteria to your context whilst retaining cited Source IDs.
3. Apply the recommended labels so automation bots trigger the appropriate workflows described in the repository.

Maintaining consistency between these templates, the source catalogue, and the references chapter ensures every Issue maintains traceable provenance.
