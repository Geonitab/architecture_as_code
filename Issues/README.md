## Structure

Each issue file follows a consistent format:
- **Title**: Descriptive issue name
- **Source IDs**: Referenced source material identifiers
- **Relevant Manuscript Sections**: Specific sections requiring verification
- **Problem Statement**: Clear description of the verification task
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable outcomes for issue completion
- **Recommended Labels**: Suggested GitHub labels for categorisation

## Usage

To create GitHub issues from these files:
1. Navigate to the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/Geonitab/architecture_as_code/issues)
2. Click "New issue"
3. Copy the content from the relevant issue file
4. Apply the recommended labels
5. Submit the issue

## Source Catalogue

The canonical list of verified sources lives in [`source_catalogue.json`](./source_catalogue.json).  
This catalogue maps each Source ID (1â€“16) to its bibliographic entry, citation URL, and the
manuscript chapters it supports. Automated validation uses this file to ensure:
- issues only reference published sources
- each source is tracked at least once
- cross-references to `docs/33_references.md` remain consistent

Update both the catalogue and the references chapter if new sources are introduced.

## Source Document

These issues were extracted from:
- **Original file**: `ISSUE_PROPOSALS_AAC_SOURCE_VALIDATION.md`
- **Source branch**: `codex/review-sources-for-aac-core-definitions-and-principles`
- **Date split**: 2025-10-16
