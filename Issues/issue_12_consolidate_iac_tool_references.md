# Issue 12: Consolidate Infrastructure as Code Tool References

## Priority
Medium

## Type
Technical reference duplication

## Component
Tool references across chapters

## Problem Statement
Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation, and Ansible are cited repeatedly across Chapters 2, 4, and 5 with minimal additional context. The repetition frames the tooling ecosystem as narrow and duplicates explanations of the same capabilities rather than expanding the reader’s understanding.

## Evidence of Repetition
- Chapter 2 – Drift Detection and Remediation: lists Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation for infrastructure state management.
- Chapter 4 – Example 1: Architecture as Code Tool Choice: reiterates Terraform’s role for all cloud environments.
- Chapter 5 – Multiple sections: repeats Terraform and Ansible as accelerants for Architecture as Code adoption.

## Impact
- Signals a limited vendor perspective.
- Misses opportunities to introduce tooling diversity or comparative insights.
- Adds unnecessary length to chapters without advancing the argument.

## Recommended Actions
1. Create a single appendix or reference section cataloguing the primary tooling options and their strengths.
2. Replace duplicate paragraphs with short references back to the consolidated list.
3. Introduce context-specific tooling only when adding new analysis (for example, unique Terraform capabilities relevant to a case study).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Appendix or tooling reference section created with comparative detail.
- [ ] Chapters 2, 4, and 5 reference the consolidated list instead of repeating identical tool descriptions.
- [ ] Each remaining tooling mention adds chapter-specific insight or rationale.

## Recommended Labels
`documentation`, `architecture`
