# Issue: Improve Testing and State Resilience for Infrastructure Pipelines

- Chapter 13: Testing Strategies (`docs/13_testing_strategies.md`)
- Chapter 14: Practical Implementation (`docs/14_practical_implementation.md`)

## Problem Statement
Current infrastructure pipelines apply limited automated testing and do not enforce robust handling for Terraform state files. The cited sources stress the need for comprehensive validation and hardened state management, yet the repository lacks example suites or documentation for these practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Introduce automated test scaffolding for IaC projects that mirrors Pulumi and Terraform guidance from the sources.
- Document encryption and remote backend configuration patterns for Terraform state, including monitoring and alerting steps.
- Provide a resilience checklist for infrastructure changes covering tests, state recovery, and rollback readiness.
