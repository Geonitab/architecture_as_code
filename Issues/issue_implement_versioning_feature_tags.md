# Implement versioning and feature tags

## Summary
Establish a formal versioning strategy for the project and introduce feature tags that help track the lifecycle of major capabilities across documentation, artefacts, and automation.

## Background
Without clear version identifiers or tagged features, it is difficult to trace when changes were introduced and which outputs they affect. A cohesive system will support release planning, communication, and auditing.

## Objectives
- Define a versioning approach (e.g., semantic versioning) that fits the cadence and scope of the project.
- Design feature tags that can be applied across the manuscript, automation, and release notes to signal when capabilities become available.
- Integrate both systems into existing workflows so they are updated automatically.

## Proposed Approach
1. Review current release practices and stakeholder expectations to select an appropriate versioning scheme.
2. Outline the taxonomy for feature tags, including naming conventions and lifecycle states.
3. Update build and release automation to apply version numbers and feature tags consistently.
4. Document the governance process for incrementing versions and retiring or evolving feature tags.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Approved versioning policy published in project documentation.
- Feature tag taxonomy defined with guidance on usage across artefacts and documentation.
- Automation updated to apply version numbers and feature tags during builds and releases.
- Evidence that the first release under the new system correctly reflects the version and associated feature tags.

## Suggested Labels
- `release`
- `process`
- `governance`
