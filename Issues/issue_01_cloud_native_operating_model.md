## Problem Statement
The introduction and operating model chapters reference authoritative market research but do not yet translate the findings into actionable guidance for Architecture as Code teams. Contributors need to surface quantified adoption signals, economic considerations, and narrative framing to help readers position the practice in an enterprise context.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Integrate a short comparative summary of the selected sources that highlights maturity trends, investment signals, and the organisational drivers behind Architecture as Code.
- Expand the introduction with a concise subsection that interprets the research data through the lens of Architecture as Code capabilities.
- Update Chapter 15 with a paragraph that connects public cloud investment forecasts to cost optimisation levers described in the book.
- Add cross-references from the organisational change chapter that demonstrate how leadership roles respond to the research insights.
