# Issue: Localise "Conclusion" Chapter to British English

**Priority:** Medium
**Suggested Labels:** documentation, localisation
**Linked Finding:** Search index review â€“ 17 October 2025

## Summary
Update the "Conclusion" chapter so that it consistently uses British English and provides balanced references for UK readers instead of relying heavily on EU terminology.

## Background
The chapter at `docs/27_conclusion/27_conclusion.md` summarises the book by highlighting European contexts, repeatedly citing GDPR, the NIS2 Directive, DORA, and the European Green Deal. It also references EU data boundary commitments and member states. The focus on EU terms without UK framing conflicts with the British English localisation objective.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace or contextualise EU-specific terminology with UK-focused equivalents or neutral descriptions.
- [ ] Ensure spelling, grammar, and idioms conform to British English throughout the chapter.
- [ ] Review mentions of data boundaries and governance proposals to clarify their relevance to UK organisations.
- [ ] Validate that conclusions align with the rest of the book after the localisation.

## Additional Notes
Consult the editorial team to maintain the chapter's overarching narrative while adjusting regional emphasis.
