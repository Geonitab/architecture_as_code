## Problem Statement
Chapter 01 outlines the promise of Architecture as Code but still relies on language that implies static presentations and committee sign-off. That framing undermines the maintainability benefits of automated alignment and creates confusion for readers who expect live artefacts. Several subsections describe "slideware" and "architecture theatre" without demonstrating how code-based controls arrest drift. The chapter also cites complex microservice estates yet does not highlight modular safety nets or refactoring disciplines required to preserve coherence.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update the introduction to emphasise continuous synchronisation between architectural definitions and running systems, drawing on current industry adoption data.
- [ ] Replace static-governance phrasing with narrative that spotlights measurable feedback loops and version-controlled decisions.
- [ ] Expand the microservice discussion with explicit maintainability practices such as boundary enforcement and incremental refactoring.
- [ ] Reference the listed sources directly within the revised prose.
