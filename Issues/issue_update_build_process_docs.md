# Update descriptions of the build process

## Summary
Revise the documentation that explains how to build the book, site, whitepapers, and presentation so it matches the current workflows and provides clear, actionable guidance for contributors.

## Background
Process documentation has drifted as automation evolved. Contributors rely on these instructions to reproduce builds locally and understand the CI/CD orchestration, so accuracy is essential.

## Objectives
- Audit existing build documentation across the repository to locate outdated steps or missing coverage.
- Align instructions with the latest scripts and workflows, including prerequisites and troubleshooting tips.
- Ensure the guidance addresses both local builds and automated pipelines.

## Proposed Approach
1. Gather all documents that describe build procedures, including scripts and workflow READMEs.
2. Compare each instruction set with the current automation to identify discrepancies.
3. Update the wording, command sequences, and diagrams where necessary to reflect the present process.
4. Request a peer review from maintainers who recently ran the builds to validate accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Updated documentation covering the build process for the book, site, whitepapers, and presentation.
- Clear prerequisites, commands, and expected outputs for local execution.
- References to the relevant CI/CD workflows and how they interrelate.
- Confirmation from reviewers that the instructions allowed them to complete builds without additional guidance.
