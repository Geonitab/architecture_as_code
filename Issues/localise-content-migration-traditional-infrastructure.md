# Issue: Localise Content to British English â€“ Migration from Traditional Infrastructure

**Chapter:** 16_migration/  
**Summary:** The migration guidance includes Swedish terminology, conflicting with the British English localisation directive.

## Observed Non-British Usage
- Terms such as "planering", "stegvis", and "Structureerade" appear in the prose.
- Narrative tone suggests Swedish localisation rather than British orientation.
- Potential mistranslations hinder clarity for British readers.

## Proposed Corrections
- Translate Swedish words into precise British English equivalents.
- Ensure all sentences flow naturally for a British audience without residual Swedish structure.
- Cross-check any Swedish-influenced examples to confirm cultural neutrality or British relevance.

## Tasks
- [ ] Replace Swedish terminology with British English wording throughout the chapter.
- [ ] Review sentence structure for lingering translation artefacts.
- [ ] Verify references and examples resonate with British practitioners.
