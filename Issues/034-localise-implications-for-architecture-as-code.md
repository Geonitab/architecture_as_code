# Localise Content to British English: Implications for Architecture as Code

The section "Implications for Architecture as Code" (located in 02_fundamental_principles/#implications-for-architecture-as-code) explores testing approaches for requirements, aiming for business alignment. It mixes spellings.

Specific issue: Uses "organization" in section context instead of British "organisation".

Example excerpt: "This dual approach – automated testing for NFRs and structured validation for FRs – enables organisations to achieve both technical excellence and business value alignment through Architecture as Code practices."

This issue tracks localisation to full British English.
