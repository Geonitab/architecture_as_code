# Localise Content to British English: Example 1: Choice of Architecture as Code Tool

The example "Example 1: Choice of Architecture as Code Tool" (located in 04_adr/#example-1-choice-of-architecture-as-code-tool) covers standardising tools for cloud environments. It uses American English.

Specific issue: Employs "organization" in ADR example context instead of British "organisation".

Example excerpt: "The organisation needs to standardise on an Architecture as Code tool to manage AWS and Azure environments."

This issue tracks changes to "organisation" for British English.
