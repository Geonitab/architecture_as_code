# Issue 17: Expand Holistic Architecture Testing Guidance

## Priority
Medium

## Type
Conceptual repetition

## Component
Testing strategies chapter

## Problem Statement
Chapter 5 introduces holistic Architecture as Code testing twice in succession—first as a conceptual overview, then as a list of unit, integration, system, and acceptance tests—without providing examples, tooling, or execution guidance. The duplicated framing feels aspirational rather than actionable.

## Evidence of Repetition
- Architecture as Code testing strategies: outlines the need for cross-domain validation.
- Holistic architecture testing: immediately restates the concept and enumerates four test levels without further depth.

## Impact
- Leaves readers without practical steps for implementing the stated test levels.
- Reinforces a perception that Architecture as Code testing lacks clarity or maturity.
- Consumes space that could host concrete examples or case studies.

## Recommended Actions
1. Retain a single introductory paragraph explaining the holistic testing intent.
2. Provide detailed examples, tools, or pipelines for each test level (unit, integration, system, acceptance).
3. Include illustrative code snippets, automation workflows, or case studies to demonstrate execution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Only one conceptual introduction to holistic testing remains.
- [ ] Each test level is backed by practical implementation detail (tooling, scripts, scenarios).
- [ ] Editorial review confirms the removal of redundant text and addition of actionable guidance.
