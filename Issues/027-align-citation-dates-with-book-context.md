# Align citation dates with book context in Chapters 1 and 2

## Summary
Resolve the temporal mismatch between 2024-dated citations and the book's implied 2025 publication context in the introduction and fundamental principles chapters.

## Tasks
- [ ] Audit the introduction and fundamental principles sections to catalogue all 2024 references and affected passages.
- [ ] Update citations with 2025 sources where available or add explicit timeframe disclaimers when newer material is not yet published.
- [ ] Refresh the bibliography entries to ensure dates and descriptions align with the clarified reference window.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The introduction and fundamental principles chapters clearly state a reference timeframe that matches the book's 2025 context.
- All cited sources are either updated to 2025 publications or accompanied by qualifying language that justifies retaining 2024 material.
- Bibliography entries for the affected sections reflect accurate publication years and descriptions.
