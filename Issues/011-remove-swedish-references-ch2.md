# Remove Swedish-specific references in Chapter 2: Fundamental Principles

## Summary
Generalise the Chapter 2 examples and guidance so that they reference EU-wide practices instead of Swedish-specific contexts.

## Tasks
- [ ] Update the OPA practical example to rename metadata, descriptions, and GDPR guidance with European terminology.
- [ ] Review the associated policy package to ensure it remains general-purpose for EU compliance.
- [ ] Revise the validation and test automation narrative to reference European regulatory validation rather than Swedish bodies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No Swedish-specific terminology, holidays, or timezone references remain in Chapter 2 content or code.
- The YAML and policy examples continue to execute correctly in an EU context.
- External references prioritise EU-wide standards and sources.
