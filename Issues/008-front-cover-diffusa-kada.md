# Update Front Cover with Diffusa K책da Code Art

## Summary
Redesign the front cover to feature "Diffusa K책da" excerpts rendered from both Mermaid and Markdown code samples, displayed in an extremely light gray tone. Include an ADR excerpt in Markdown within the showcased code.

## Tasks
- Extract representative Mermaid and Markdown snippets related to Diffusa K책da from the manuscript.
- Incorporate an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) segment in Markdown alongside the snippets.
- Apply a very light gray color treatment so the code is barely legible, ensuring it still aligns with accessibility standards.
- Update the cover design files and confirm the build pipeline uses the revised cover.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The front cover displays Diffusa K책da content in both Mermaid and Markdown code forms with the required light gray styling.
- An ADR excerpt in Markdown is visible within the cover artwork.
- The publishing pipeline outputs the updated cover without regressions.
