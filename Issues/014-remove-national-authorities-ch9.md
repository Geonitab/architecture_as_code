# Remove national authorities from Chapter 9: Security and Governance

## Summary
Replace Swedish authority references in Chapter 9 with EU-level governance bodies and ensure policy code targets European compliance.

## Tasks
- [ ] Update the "Security Fundamentals" narrative to reference EU bodies such as the EDPB instead of MSB or Finansinspektionen.
- [ ] Rename the OPA package from `sweden.gdpr` to `european.gdpr` and adjust associated metadata.
- [ ] Generalise strategic recommendations to promote EU-wide threat intelligence collaboration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Policy examples evaluate correctly for EU compliance without country-specific authorities.
- All textual references use EU-level governance bodies only.
- CMMI assessments and recommendations align with European standards.
