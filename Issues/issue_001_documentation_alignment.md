## Relevant Manuscript Sections

- Chapter 03: Version Control (`docs/03_version_control.md`)
- Chapter 22: Documentation vs Architecture (`docs/22_documentation_vs_architecture.md`)

## Problem Statement
Architecture contributors rely on a mixture of wikis and ad-hoc notes, which undermines traceability for decision records and documentation updates. The book advocates managing documentation alongside architecture artefacts, yet the repository lacks an integrated workflow and templates to make this practical for contributors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- ADR templates and contribution guidelines reference a shared documentation workflow using Git-based reviews.
- Automation linting ensures markdown contributions follow the agreed conventions for headings and link formats.
- Version control guidance explicitly points to documentation-as-code examples that reflect the book's recommendations.

## Recommended Labels
- `documentation`
- `architecture`
- `dev`
