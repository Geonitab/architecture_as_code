## Problem Statement
The automation chapters advocate for continuous testing of infrastructure definitions, yet the repository lacks a sequenced set of issues to build and maintain those safeguards. Without this backlog, teams risk regressions in deployment pipelines, insufficient coverage of IaC unit tests, and limited visibility of platform quality metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Automated test harness created for representative Terraform, Pulumi, and CDK modules referenced in the manuscript.
- Continuous integration jobs execute the harness on every pull request and publish results as part of the book's artefact exports.
- Testing documentation outlines the minimum expected coverage for infrastructure modules and explains how to extend scenarios.
- Runbooks include guidance for triaging failing infrastructure tests, ensuring operations teams can respond within agreed service levels.
