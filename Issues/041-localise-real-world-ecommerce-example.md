# Localise Content to British English: Real-World Example: Complete E-Commerce Platform

The section "Real-World Example: Complete E-Commerce Platform" (located in 06_structurizr/#real-world-example-complete-e-commerce-platform) provides a full Structurizr example for an e-commerce system. It uses American spellings.

Specific issue: Employs "color" instead of British "colour", repeated in styling sections.

Example excerpt: "element \"Person\" { shape person background #08427b color #ffffff fontSize 22 } ..."

This issue tracks localisation to "colour" and British consistency.
