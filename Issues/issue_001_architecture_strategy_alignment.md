# Align Architecture Strategy Narrative with Foundational Sources

## Source IDs
- [1] ThoughtWorks. "Architecture as Code: The Next Evolution." Technology Radar, 2024.
- [2] Martin, R. "Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure." Prentice Hall, 2017.
- [3] Brown, S. "C4 Model Overview." https://c4model.com/.
- [4] Atlassian. "Documentation as Code: Treating Docs as a First-Class Citizen." Atlassian Developer, 2023.

## Relevant Manuscript Sections
- `01_introduction.md` – refine the strategic framing of Architecture as Code using the named industry research.
- `02_fundamental_principles.md` – incorporate explicit nods to Clean Architecture and documentation-as-code practice.
- `06_structurizr.md` – ensure the C4 model narrative references the authoritative overview.
- `24_best_practices.md` – align best-practice guidance with the same structural sources.

## Problem Statement
The introductory and foundational chapters cite the listed sources but lack explicit synthesis. Readers struggle to connect the strategic messaging from ThoughtWorks and Atlassian with the practical framing from Clean Architecture and the C4 model. The sections read as parallel narratives rather than a cohesive argument, which weakens the early positioning of Architecture as Code.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The introduction directly references the ThoughtWorks and Atlassian materials when explaining why Architecture as Code is timely.
- Chapter 2 links the Clean Architecture principles to documentation-as-code workflows and to the C4 viewpoint.
- Chapters 6 and 24 clearly attribute diagramming guidance to the C4 overview with inline citations.
- All edits retain British English spelling and conform to the current chapter structure.
