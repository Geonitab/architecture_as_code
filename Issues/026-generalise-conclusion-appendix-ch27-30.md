# Generalise conclusion and appendix in Chapters 27 and 30

## Summary
Broaden the conclusion and appendix materials to highlight European ambitions and neutral regional configurations.

## Tasks
- [ ] Update the Chapter 27 conclusion to emphasise EU-wide GDPR data residency objectives rather than Swedish ambitions.
- [ ] Revise appendix code examples to use generic EU regions, rename tests to `TestEuropeanTagging`, and remove Swedish holiday references.
- [ ] Validate that appendix configurations deploy successfully across multiple EU regions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Conclusion and appendix text reinforce European ambitions without Swedish terminology.
- All appendix code samples and tests reference generic EU regions and holidays.
- Deployment examples function across EU regions without modification.
