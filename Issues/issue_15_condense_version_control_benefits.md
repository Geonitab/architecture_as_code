# Issue 15: Condense Version Control Benefit Narratives

## Priority
Low

## Type
Conceptual repetition

## Component
Version control chapter

## Problem Statement
Chapter 3 describes the benefits of Git-based workflows three times with overlapping language about commit history, documentation of change intent, and collaboration. The repeated passages fail to add new perspectives or examples, leaving the reader with redundant prose rather than practical guidance.

## Evidence of Repetition
- Git-based workflow section: emphasises distributed collaboration and commit messages explaining what and why.
- Transparency through version control: reiterates commit messages and audit trail benefits.
- Commit history: once again highlights traceability of architectural evolution and decision context.

## Impact
- Reduces information density within Chapter 3.
- Suggests there are limited additional insights into version control usage.
- Risks reader disengagement due to repetitive phrasing.

## Recommended Actions
1. Merge the overlapping paragraphs into a single, comprehensive explanation of Git benefits.
2. Introduce new value-add material, such as workflow diagrams, branching strategies, or tooling integrations, to replace removed text.
3. Provide concrete examples (for example, sample commit message, pull request template) to diversify the discussion.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Chapter 3 contains one consolidated section covering commit history, audit trails, and collaboration benefits.
- [ ] Additional content demonstrates practical application of version control beyond the consolidated summary.
- [ ] Editorial review confirms the removal of redundant paragraphs.

## Recommended Labels
`documentation`, `editor`
