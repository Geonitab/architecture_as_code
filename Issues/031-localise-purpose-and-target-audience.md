# Localise Content to British English: Purpose and Target Audience of the Book

The section "Purpose and Target Audience of the Book" (located in 01_introduction/#purpose-and-target-audience-of-the-book) outlines the book's aims for architects, developers, and IT decision-makers. It contains American English.

Specific issue: Employs "organizations" instead of British "organisations".

Example excerpt: "This book is aimed at system architects, developers, project managers, and IT decision-makers who want to understand and implement Architecture as Code within their organizations."

This issue tracks the localisation to British English, changing "organizations" to "organisations".
