# Issue 21: Vary “Architecture as Code…” Sentence Structures

## Priority
Low

## Type
Stylistic repetition

## Component
Manuscript narrative

## Problem Statement
Across multiple chapters, sentences frequently begin with “Architecture as Code is…”, “Architecture as Code enables…”, or “Architecture as Code requires…”. The repetitive construction produces monotonous prose and obscures the subject performing the action.

## Evidence of Repetition
Examples include:
1. “Architecture as Code represents a paradigm shift…”
2. “Architecture as Code is founded on core principles…”
3. “Architecture as Code enables testing of the entire system…”
4. “Architecture as Code requires testing strategies…”
5. “Architecture as Code represents the future…”

## Impact
- Reduces narrative variety and reader engagement.
- Masks opportunities to highlight actors (teams, architects, pipelines) performing the work.
- Makes the text feel formulaic and less persuasive.

## Recommended Actions
1. Rewrite repetitive sentences using pronouns, abbreviations (AaC), or alternative subjects where appropriate.
2. Introduce active voice with clear actors (for example, “Teams adopting AaC can test…”).
3. Limit full “Architecture as Code…” phrases to first mention per section, using “AaC” thereafter for flow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit of chapters identifies and rewrites repetitive sentence openings.
- [ ] Revised prose demonstrates varied sentence structure and active voice.
- [ ] Editorial review confirms improved narrative flow without loss of clarity.
