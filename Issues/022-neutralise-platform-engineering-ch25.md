# Neutralise platform engineering in Chapter 25: Future Trends

## Summary
Update the Chapter 25 platform engineering implementation to provide EU-compliant stacks without Swedish localisation.

## Tasks
- [x] Rename data fields such as `swedish_compliance_status` to European equivalents.
- [x] Generalise financial compliance references to EU-wide standards like PSD2.
- [x] Confirm that the platform engineering API provisions EU-compliant environments without localisation strings.

## Acceptance Criteria
- API payloads and responses use European terminology only.
- All references to Swedish compliance statuses are removed or replaced.
- Platform engineering guidance supports EU-wide deployment scenarios.

## Implementation Notes

### Verification Completed
Chapter 25 (`docs/25_future_trends_development.md`) has been verified to be already neutralized:

1. **Platform Engineering Section**: Contains only conceptual content without code examples
2. **No Swedish-specific fields**: No `swedish_compliance_status` or similar localised data fields
3. **EU-compliant approach**: The chapter discusses platform engineering in general, EU-applicable terms
4. **Financial compliance**: References are generic (FinOps, cost optimization) without Swedish-specific regulations

### Historical Context
The archived version (`docs/archive/25_future_trends.md`) previously contained Swedish-specific platform engineering code examples including:
- `swedish_compliance_status` field in API responses
- Swedish-specific Terraform module references (`swedish-alb`)
- Swedish business hours optimisation
- Swedish holiday calendars

These have been removed from the active chapter, which now focuses on general European and global platform engineering best practices.

### Status
âœ… **All acceptance criteria met:**
- API payloads and responses use European terminology only (no code examples present)
- All references to Swedish compliance statuses removed
- Platform engineering guidance supports EU-wide deployment scenarios
