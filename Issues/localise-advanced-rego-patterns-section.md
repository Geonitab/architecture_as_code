# Issue: Localise "Advanced Rego Patterns for Regulated Workloads" to British English

**Priority:** Medium
**Suggested Labels:** documentation, localisation
**Linked Finding:** Search index review â€“ 17 October 2025

## Summary
Rework the "Advanced Rego Patterns for Regulated Workloads" section to align with British English spellings and provide region-neutral compliance examples that resonate with UK audiences.

## Background
The section at `docs/10_policy_and_security/10_policy_and_security_as_code_in_detail.md#advanced-rego-patterns-for-regulated-workloads` cites EU-specific concepts such as EU residency checks and regulator-linked locales. Whilst informative, the language assumes a European Union regulatory baseline and mixes spelling conventions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit the section for American spellings or EU-centric terminology that lacks British framing.
- [ ] Replace American spellings with British equivalents and clarify regulatory examples using UK-oriented scenarios where helpful.
- [ ] Ensure references to residency checks and compliance scoring explain their relevance to UK regulations.
- [ ] Validate that cross-references within the chapter remain accurate after updates.

## Additional Notes
Coordinate changes with any associated diagrams or code snippets to preserve terminology consistency across the chapter.
