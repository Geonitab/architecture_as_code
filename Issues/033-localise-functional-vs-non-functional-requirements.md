# Localise Content to British English: Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements as Code

The section "Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements as Code" (located in 02_fundamental_principles/#functional-vs-non-functional-requirements-as-code) discusses implications for implementation, including CI/CD integration. It includes American spellings in context.

Specific issue: Uses "organization" in section context instead of British "organisation".

Example excerpt: "This distinction has profound implications for how Architecture as Code is implemented: NFR Testing in CI/CD : Non-functional requirements integrate seamlessly into continuous deployment pipelines."

This issue tracks updates for British English consistency.
