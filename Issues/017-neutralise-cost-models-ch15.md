# Neutralise cost models in Chapter 15: Cost Optimisation

## Summary
Rework Chapter 15 cost examples to use EU-wide pricing assumptions and currency without Swedish specificity.

## Tasks
- [ ] Convert all cost figures from SEK to EUR within the chapter content and calculations.
- [ ] Reference EU-wide energy pricing and GDPR storage guidelines rather than Swedish metrics.
- [ ] Provide examples that illustrate cost modelling across multiple EU regions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Cost calculations operate correctly using EUR.
- No Swedish currency, pricing references, or regional assumptions remain.
- Examples cover at least two EU regions to demonstrate applicability.
