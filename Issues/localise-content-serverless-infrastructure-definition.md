# Issue: Localise Content to British English â€“ Serverless Infrastructure Definition

**Section:** 12_compliance/#serverless-infrastructure-definition  
**Summary:** The serverless configuration mixes British and American spellings, notably around optimisation terminology.

## Observed Non-British Usage
- Environment variables reference `OPTIMISATION` whilst surrounding comments imply "optimization".
- Inconsistent spelling across YAML keys and narrative guidance.
- Potential confusion for readers adopting British English standards.

## Proposed Corrections
- Ensure all references to optimisation within the section adopt the British spelling consistently.
- Align environment variable naming and descriptive text with British English conventions.
- Provide clarification if legacy naming requires dual spelling, offering migration advice.

## Tasks
- [ ] Harmonise YAML keys, environment variables, and prose to use "optimisation".
- [ ] Update commentary to reinforce British English spelling expectations.
- [ ] Document any compatibility considerations when renaming configuration values.
