## Problem Statement
Although the manuscript promotes documentation as code disciplines, there is no explicit backlog to align ADR workflows with the documentation automation pipeline. Contributors frequently capture decisions without linking them to the structured content strategy, leading to discoverability issues and fragmented review discussions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- ADR templates updated to include required metadata for linking to chapters, diagrams, and backlog items.
- Continuous integration checks confirming that every ADR referenced in the manuscript exists in the repository with validated front matter.
- Contribution guidelines refreshed so new ADRs automatically feed into the documentation site navigation and changelog process.
- Example ADR migration plan created to demonstrate how legacy decisions will be imported into the new format.
