## Problem Statement
The ADR chapter and foundational principles discuss documentation-as-code and architectural rigour separately. The sources above emphasise that disciplined decision records depend on reliable Git workflows and shared quality standards. The manuscript currently hints at this dependency but stops short of illustrating how Clean Architecture thinking and ADR governance combine in day-to-day authoring.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update the ADR chapter to include a workflow diagram or narrative that ties decision capture to Git-based collaboration patterns.
- [ ] Reference Clean Architecture principles when explaining why ADRs must connect to modular design boundaries.
- [ ] Cross-link the fundamentals chapter so readers can follow the documentation-as-code argument through to ADR implementation guidance.
