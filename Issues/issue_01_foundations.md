## Problem Statement
Current wording in the introductory chapters references the selected sources but does not fully emphasise how recent industry commentary and classic architectural literature reinforce Architecture as Code as a leadership discipline. The first two chapters should weave the Cloud Native Computing Foundation report, ThoughtWorks perspective, and Clean Architecture lessons into a single narrative that clarifies why readers must treat architectural practice as executable policy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Introductory chapters explicitly connect the CNCF and ThoughtWorks research to the book's adoption message using British English terminology.
- References to *Clean Architecture* and Atlassian's documentation guidance are used to demonstrate how Architecture as Code extends proven engineering practices.
- Source citations remain in the existing "Sources" sections with consistent formatting.
- Updated content is reviewed to ensure tone and reading level align with the rest of the manuscript.
