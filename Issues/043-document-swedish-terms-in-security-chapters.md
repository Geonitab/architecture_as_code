### Issue Title: Documentation of Swedish Terms in Security Fundamentals and Patterns Chapters

**Description:**

This issue tracks the integration and description of Swedish words and phrases identified in the Security Fundamentals (Chapter 09a) and Security Patterns (Chapter 09b) sections of the Architecture as Code documentation. These terms primarily relate to regulatory compliance, authorities, and practical implementations tailored for Swedish environments, ensuring alignment with national standards such as GDPR and MSB guidelines.

#### Key Subsections and Examples:

1. **Swedish Authorities and Regulatory Sources (09a_security_fundamentals/#swedish-authorities-and-regulatory-sources):**
   - MSB (Myndigheten för samhällsskydd och beredskap): Example - "MSB. General Guidance on Information Security for Essential Services. Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, 2023." This provides national guidance for critical infrastructure protection.
   - Finansinspektionen (Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority): Example - "Finansinspektionen. Regulations on Operational Risk (FFFS 2014:1, consolidated 2023)." Focuses on operational risk in the financial sector.
   - Dataskyddslagen (SFS 2018:218): Example - "Dataskyddslagen (SFS 2018:218). Supplementary Provisions to the EU General Data Protection Regulation." Supplements GDPR with Swedish-specific data protection rules.
   - Säkerhetsskyddslagen (SFS 2018:585): Example - "Säkerhetsskyddslagen (SFS 2018:585). Swedish Protective Security Act." Covers protective security for sensitive operations.
   - FFFS 2014:1: Regulations on Operational Risk, consolidated 2023.

2. **Swedish Organisations and Expertise (09a_security_fundamentals/#swedish-organisations-and-expertise):**
   - Internetstiftelsen (Swedish Internet Foundation): Example - "Swedish Internet Foundation. Cybersecurity Report 2023. Internetstiftelsen, 2023." Annual report on cybersecurity threats.
   - Swedish Incert (Swedish Computer Emergency Response Team): Example - "Swedish Incert. Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Report 2023." Analysis of the threat landscape.
   - Cybercom Group AB: Example - "Cybercom Group. Nordic Cybersecurity Survey 2023." Survey covering Nordic, including Swedish, cybersecurity.
   - KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan): Example - "KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Cybersecurity Research Publications." Academic contributions from a Swedish institute.

3. **Practical Implementations for Swedish Environments (09b_security_patterns/#practical-implementation-security-architecture-in-swedish-environments):**
   - MSB guidance (Myndigheten för samhällsskydd och beredskap): Example - Terraform code with locals like `security_tags = { SecurityBaseline = "swedish-gov-baseline" }` and AWS KMS rotation aligned with Swedish expectations.
   - Swedish-gov-baseline: Used in resource tags for national compliance.
   - Swedish Protective Security Act: Example - Python function `assess_supply_chain_risks` noting impact on the Act.
   - Swedish security expectations: Example - Approved regions like `["eu-north-1", "eu-west-1", "eu-central-1"]`.
   - Swedish best practice: Example - Python class `AdvancedThreatDetection` with `msb_compliance_score` in reports.
   - Swedish organisations: Referenced in module descriptions for automated controls.
   - package sweden.gdpr: Example - Rego policy `personal_data_encryption_required` for GDPR Article 32.

**Proposed Actions:**
- Review and incorporate these terms into the main documentation for better localisation.
- Ensure code examples (e.g., Terraform, Python, Rego) are tested in Swedish-compliant environments like eu-north-1.

**Labels:** documentation, localisation, security
