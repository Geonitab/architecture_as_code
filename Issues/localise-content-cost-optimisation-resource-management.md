# Issue: Localise Content to British English â€“ Cost Optimisation and Resource Management

**Chapter:** 15_cost_optimization/  
**Summary:** The chapter title and content retain American spellings of "optimisation", clashing with British English requirements.

## Observed Non-British Usage
- Directory name and headings use "Optimization" instead of "Optimisation".
- Narrative and diagrams echo American spelling choices.
- Potential downstream references inherit the American variant.

## Proposed Corrections
- Rename chapter headings and internal references to "Optimisation".
- Update textual content to British spellings and verify cross-references within the book.
- Consider renaming files if technically feasible, documenting any build implications.

## Tasks
- [ ] Replace occurrences of "Optimization" with "Optimisation" across the chapter.
- [ ] Review associated assets (figures, diagrams, links) for consistent spelling.
- [ ] Adjust navigation metadata or configuration to reflect the British spelling.
