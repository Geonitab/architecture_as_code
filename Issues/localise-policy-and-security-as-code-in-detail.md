## Summary
Adapt the "Policy and Security as Code in Detail" chapter to employ British English terminology and balanced regulatory references so the narrative feels relevant for UK readers.

## Background
The chapter located at `docs/10_policy_and_security/10_policy_and_security_as_code_in_detail.md` leans on EU-centric regulatory language such as GDPR, the NIS2 Directive, the European Banking Authority, ENISA, and PSD2, while also referencing the UK's Financial Conduct Authority without British context. The current text emphasises European Union obligations and examples, resulting in mixed regional framing that dilutes a British-first viewpoint. An appendix example (`10_CODE_1`) is tailored primarily for EU and UK regulators without clarifying the British adaptations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review the chapter and identify all EU-specific regulatory terms and references to non-British locales.
- [ ] Update wording to ensure British English spellings throughout (for example, "organisation", "optimisation").
- [ ] Reframe regulatory examples to foreground UK applicability while acknowledging EU influences only where essential.
- [ ] Confirm that related appendix material reflects the updated language and guidance.

## Additional Notes
Coordinate with compliance subject-matter experts to maintain accuracy when translating EU references into UK-centric explanations.
