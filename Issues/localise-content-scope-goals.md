# Issue: Localise Content to British English â€“ Scope and Goals of the Chapter

**Section:** 09a_security_fundamentals/#scope-and-goals-of-the-chapter  
**Summary:** The scope statement lists EU regulations and directives, eroding British localisation fidelity.

## Observed Non-British Usage
- Enumerates GDPR, EDPB, and NIS2 Directive requirements.
- Presents compliance goals from an EU regulatory perspective.
- Uses terminology that implies a continental policy environment.

## Proposed Corrections
- Reframe objectives to align with UK GDPR, the Data Protection Act 2018, and NCSC directives.
- Provide British English explanations for any retained references to EU frameworks.
- Ensure the section signposts British regulatory resources for readers.

## Tasks
- [ ] Edit the section narrative to emphasise British legal drivers.
- [ ] Replace or annotate EU acronyms with UK-specific counterparts.
- [ ] Validate that referenced policies match the UK's post-Brexit regulatory landscape.
