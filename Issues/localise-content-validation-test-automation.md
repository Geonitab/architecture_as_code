# Issue: Localise Content to British English â€“ Validation and Test Automation

**Section:** 02_fundamental_principles/#validation-and-test-automation  
**Summary:** The validation automation example is anchored to EU supervisory bodies, embedding non-British terminology and locale codes.

## Observed Non-British Usage
- Hard-coded references to GDPR, EDPB guidance, and ENISA baselines.
- Uses American-style capitalisation in constants alongside EU agency names.
- Positions regulatory validation from an EU authority perspective rather than a British frame.

## Proposed Corrections
- Reorient the example towards British regulators such as the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).
- Replace locale constants and comments with British English spellings and local regulatory references.
- Provide contextual notes if retaining any EU-wide terminology is essential for comparative reasons.

## Tasks
- [ ] Revise code snippets to use British agency names and British English spellings.
- [ ] Update accompanying prose to describe validation expectations for the United Kingdom.
- [ ] Confirm glossary entries for regulatory terms align with British English conventions.
