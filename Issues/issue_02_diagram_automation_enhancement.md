## Problem Statement
The Structurizr automation chapter explains the rationale for diagrams as code but lacks an incremental roadmap for automating reviews, publishing rendered assets, and keeping diagram context synchronised with ADRs. Teams therefore fall back to manual exports, which undermines the consistency expected by the manuscript's workflow guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Automated pipeline steps render Structurizr diagrams on pull requests and attach the resulting PNG artefacts to build outputs.
- Diagram definitions link to canonical ADR identifiers, ensuring reviewers can cross-reference structural decisions quickly.
- Documentation explains how to regenerate diagrams locally with a single command, including troubleshooting steps for common platform tooling.
- Quality checks prevent merging changes when diagrams and markdown representations drift.
