## Problem Statement
The later chapters draw on market forecasts and industry initiatives but do not consistently translate those findings into actionable adoption strategies. Readers need clearer linkage between market momentum, organisational capability shifts, and open collaboration exemplars such as FINOS CALM.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Chapters 15, 17, 21, 25, 27, and 32 explicitly reference the market data and surveys to justify investment milestones and change management recommendations.
- The FINOS CALM source is used to illustrate how industry collaboration accelerates Architecture as Code adoption in regulated environments.
- Source IDs [13]–[16] are cited within their existing "Sources" sections using British English spelling and consistent markdown structure.
- Updates reinforce measurable outcomes (cost, capability, governance) that executives can track when adopting Architecture as Code.

## Recommended Labels
