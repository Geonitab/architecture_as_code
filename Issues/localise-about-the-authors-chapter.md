# Issue: Localise "About the Authors" Chapter to British English

**Priority:** Medium
**Suggested Labels:** documentation, localisation
**Linked Finding:** Search index review – 17 October 2025

## Summary
Update the "About the Authors" chapter to use British English spellings and moderate Swedish-specific references so the section aligns with the localisation standard.

## Background
`docs/29_about_the_authors/29_about_the_authors.md` profiles the author and contributors, referencing Swedish organisations such as Kvadrat AB and academic institutions including KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Linköping University, and Malmö University. American spellings like "organizations" appear alongside Swedish-language descriptors, producing inconsistency with the British English guideline and an overly Swedish emphasis.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace all American spellings with British English equivalents throughout the chapter.
- [ ] Evaluate Swedish-specific references and determine whether they should be generalised, anglicised, or supplemented with UK context.
- [ ] Ensure biographies remain accurate after localisation changes.
- [ ] Review headings and lists to confirm consistent terminology.

## Additional Notes
Coordinate with the author to preserve intent whilst aligning with localisation requirements.
