# Issue: Localise "Professional Background" Section to British English

**Priority:** Low
**Suggested Labels:** documentation, localisation
**Linked Finding:** Search index review â€“ 17 October 2025

## Summary
Adjust the "Professional Background" section to deliver British English spellings and clarify terminology that currently leans on EU or mixed-language references.

## Background
The section `docs/29_about_the_authors/29_about_the_authors.md#professional-background` lists expertise areas such as Infrastructure as Code and Architecture as Code, IT Security and Compliance, and Cloud Architecture and Virtualisation. Some spellings are inconsistent (for example, variations of "virtualisation"), and the surrounding text implies EU-centric terminology.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review the section for American spellings or mixed-language usage and convert them to British English.
- [ ] Clarify references to EU regulatory contexts, ensuring the emphasis remains relevant to UK readers.
- [ ] Confirm bullet lists and headings follow a consistent grammatical style after revisions.
- [ ] Ensure the updated language aligns with neighbouring subsections.

## Additional Notes
Coordinate edits with the broader "About the Authors" chapter localisation to prevent conflicting terminology.
