## Problem Statement
The automation and testing chapters cite DevOps references but the thread between GitLab's single-source guidance, evolutionary architecture intent, and Pulumi's testing patterns is currently implicit. Readers should be able to see how disciplined evolution, shared documentation practices, and automated validation combine to deliver trustworthy Architecture as Code pipelines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Expand the automation chapter with a short scenario showing how GitLab workflows and Pulumi testing fit together.
- [ ] Clarify how evolutionary architecture principles translate into measurable acceptance criteria for continuous delivery.
- [ ] Add references that map each testing capability to the supporting documentation-as-code practices to reinforce the single-source narrative.
