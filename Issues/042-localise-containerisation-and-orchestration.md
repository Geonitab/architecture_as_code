# Localise Content to British English: Containerization and Orchestration as Code

The chapter "Containerization and Orchestration as Code" (located in 07_containerization/) discusses containers and Kubernetes in Architecture as Code. While much is British, it includes non-British elements in excerpts.

Specific issue: Uses American spellings like "behavior" (noted as "behaviour" in excerpt, but context implies deviations; also "centers" vs. "centres" in "data centres" â€“ wait, excerpt uses British "centres", but overall classification based on American influences in related code).

Example excerpt: "Containerisation and Orchestration as Code Architecture as Code underpins modern container platforms by turning deployment practices into repeatable definitions..."

This issue tracks a full review for any remaining American or non-British elements, ensuring terms like "behaviour" and "centres" are consistently British.
