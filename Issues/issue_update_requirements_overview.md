# Update requirements.md to reflect the current content of the book

## Summary
Refresh `requirements.md` so it accurately reflects the present structure of the book and documents every deliverable produced by the `build-all` job, including the book, the site, the whitepapers, and the presentation.

## Background
The requirements overview has fallen behind ongoing manuscript and workflow updates. Keeping it current ensures contributors and stakeholders understand the scope of the deliverables and how the automation assembles them.

## Objectives
- Review the latest manuscript, site, whitepapers, and presentation outputs to capture their current structure and dependencies.
- Align the requirements document with the deliverables produced by `build-all`, ensuring none are omitted.
- Incorporate references to supporting automation or scripts so the end-to-end process is transparent.

## Proposed Approach
1. Inspect the current `build-all` workflow and associated scripts to map every output it generates.
2. Compare the existing `requirements.md` content against the observed outputs, noting gaps or outdated statements.
3. Update the document with accurate descriptions, including any new sections, artefacts, or dependencies.
4. Validate the wording with the editorial team to maintain consistent terminology across the book and documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `requirements.md` lists every deliverable produced by the `build-all` job with up-to-date descriptions.
- The document references the current manuscript structure, site, whitepapers, and presentation.
- Any new automation steps or dependencies introduced since the last revision are documented.
- Stakeholders confirm the refreshed document aligns with the present state of the project.

## Suggested Labels
- `documentation`
- `requirements`
- `editorial`
