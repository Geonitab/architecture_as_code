## Problem Statement
Governance chapters describe policy automation concepts but currently lack clear ties between market sentiment, organisational readiness, and specific control mechanisms. The selected sources provide empirical data and platform-level practices that should be woven into the manuscript.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Introduce a subsection that links executive confidence levels from the HashiCorp survey to governance-as-code adoption barriers.
- Reference GitHub and GitLab guidance to provide concrete examples of protective controls and workflow automation.
- Expand the Software as Code interplay chapter with a paragraph that explains how Policy as Code frameworks operationalise governance checkpoints.
- Ensure organisational change guidance highlights the human and process adjustments inferred from the research sources.
