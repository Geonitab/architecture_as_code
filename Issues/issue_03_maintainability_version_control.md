# Improve Maintainability Guidance in Chapter 03: Version Control and Code Structure

- Chapter 14 – Practical Implementation Patterns

## Problem Statement
The version control chapter introduces repository layouts but overlooks patterns for keeping architectural modules sustainable. There is minimal advice on automating dependency checks, validating pull requests, or using infrastructure testing harnesses before merges. Without those practices teams risk branching strategies that permit architectural drift and brittle refactors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document mandatory branch protections and automated checks that safeguard architectural artefacts.
- [ ] Illustrate how infrastructure testing frameworks (for example CDK assertions) validate architectural intent before merging.
- [ ] Provide guidance on structuring repositories so shared modules remain discoverable and maintainable over time.
- [ ] Cite the referenced sources where new recommendations are inserted.
