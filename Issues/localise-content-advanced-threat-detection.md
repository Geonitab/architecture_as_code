# Issue: Localise Content to British English â€“ Advanced Threat Detection Platform

**Section:** 09b_security_patterns/#advanced-threat-detection-platform  
**Summary:** The threat detection pattern is anchored to Swedish organisational contexts, conflicting with British English localisation.

## Observed Non-British Usage
- Describes solutions for "Swedish organisations" directly within code comments.
- Uses geographic assumptions that do not translate to British readers.
- Lacks British equivalents or generalised wording.

## Proposed Corrections
- Update examples to reference British sectors or use neutral terminology applicable in the UK.
- Ensure comments and docstrings adopt British English spellings and references.
- Add British-centric threat intelligence sources where relevant.

## Tasks
- [ ] Replace Swedish locale references with British or neutral alternatives.
- [ ] Audit associated comments for spelling and terminology alignment.
- [ ] Provide contextual notes referencing UK threat intelligence guidance.
