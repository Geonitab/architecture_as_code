# Issue: Localise "Testing Strategies for Infrastructure Code" to British English

**Priority:** High
**Suggested Labels:** documentation, localisation
**Linked Finding:** Search index review â€“ 17 October 2025

## Summary
Bring the "Testing Strategies for Infrastructure Code" chapter in line with British English spelling and ensure compliance examples accommodate UK contexts rather than relying on EU-specific framing.

## Background
Within `docs/13_testing_strategies/13_testing_strategies_for_infrastructure_code.md`, the narrative mixes American spellings such as "organizations", "behavior", and "realize" with references to EU instruments like GDPR and locales such as "EU-only regions". The combination creates linguistic inconsistency and an EU-oriented bias that does not align with the repository's British English requirement.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace all American spellings with their British English counterparts (for example, "organisations", "behaviour", "realise").
- [ ] Evaluate regulatory references and provide UK-focused compliance examples or neutral phrasing where appropriate.
- [ ] Review technical examples to confirm terminology remains accurate after edits.
- [ ] Ensure any subsections or cross-links reflect the updated language.

## Additional Notes
Consider collaborating with compliance reviewers to confirm UK references remain current and authoritative.
