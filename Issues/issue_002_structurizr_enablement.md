## Relevant Manuscript Sections
- Chapter 06: Structurizr and Diagram Automation (`docs/06_structurizr.md`)
- Chapter 24: Best Practices (`docs/24_best_practices.md`)
- Chapter 31: Technical Architecture (`docs/31_technical_architecture.md`)

## Problem Statement
Teams struggle to apply Structurizr effectively, leading to inconsistent diagram styles and duplication of effort across programmes. The manuscript highlights how the C4 model and Structurizr tooling underpin maintainable diagrams, yet the repository lacks onboarding material and shared viewpoints to make adoption straightforward.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Provide a curated Structurizr workspace example aligned to the C4 abstractions referenced in the book.
- Document the contribution process for updating diagrams, including review expectations and automation steps.
- Publish guidance on applying evolutionary architecture fitness functions to ongoing diagram updates.
