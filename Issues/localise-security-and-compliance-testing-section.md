# Issue: Localise "Security and Compliance Testing" Section to British English

**Priority:** Medium
**Suggested Labels:** documentation, localisation
**Linked Finding:** Search index review â€“ 17 October 2025

## Summary
Ensure the "Security and Compliance Testing" section reflects British English spelling and introduces UK-relevant compliance framing instead of EU-only references.

## Background
The section at `docs/13_testing_strategies/13_testing_strategies_for_infrastructure_code.md#security-and-compliance-testing` retains American spellings such as "organizations" and emphasises EU-centric regulations including GDPR. This combination conflicts with the repository's localisation standards and creates a European Union emphasis without sufficient British context.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace American spellings with British English equivalents throughout the section.
- [ ] Adjust regulatory references to highlight UK compliance expectations, keeping EU mentions only where they provide necessary contrast.
- [ ] Confirm that surrounding paragraphs and examples align with the revised terminology.
- [ ] Update any related call-outs or tables to reflect the localisation changes.

## Additional Notes
Align changes with the broader chapter updates to avoid reintroducing mixed spelling or regulatory perspectives.
