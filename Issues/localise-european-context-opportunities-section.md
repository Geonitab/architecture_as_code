# Issue: Localise "European Context and Opportunities" Section to British English

**Priority:** Medium
**Suggested Labels:** documentation, localisation
**Linked Finding:** Search index review â€“ 17 October 2025

## Summary
Refine the "European Context and Opportunities" section to maintain British English spelling and reposition EU references so the guidance speaks directly to UK readers.

## Background
Within `docs/27_conclusion/27_conclusion.md#273-european-context-and-opportunities`, the prose cites GDPR, the NIS2 Directive, DORA, and the European Green Deal, all framed through EU member state commitments. Whilst informative, the emphasis can appear detached from UK-specific priorities and introduces an imbalance with the rest of the British English manuscript.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review the section for American spellings or EU-centric idioms and replace them with British English equivalents.
- [ ] Clarify how each regulatory reference applies to UK organisations, or provide neutral comparisons where direct applicability is limited.
- [ ] Align any linked recommendations or call-outs with the revised language.
- [ ] Confirm that navigation anchors and headings remain correct after edits.

## Additional Notes
Coordinate with the conclusion chapter updates to avoid duplicated or conflicting phrasing regarding UK versus EU opportunities.
