## Problem Statement
Chapter 09A highlights the fragility of state files and secrets yet leaves readers without a sustained operational playbook. The chapter does not explain how to automate key rotation, enforce remote backends, or continuously audit access paths. These omissions create ongoing maintenance risk when securing architecture artefacts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Provide stepwise guidance for adopting encrypted remote state backends across major cloud providers.
- [ ] Describe automated monitoring and alerting for state drift, stale credentials, and unauthorised access attempts.
- [ ] Detail playbooks for rotating keys and updating dependent services without downtime.
- [ ] Attribute the expanded material to the referenced sources.
