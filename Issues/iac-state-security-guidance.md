# Issue: Anchor IaC State Security Guidance to Verified Sources

**Priority:** High  
**Suggested Labels:** documentation, security  
**Linked Finding:** #10 â€“ State Management Security

## Summary
Ensure the security chapters explicitly cite Source [16] (and other relevant references) when discussing the protection of IaC state files.

## Background
Secure management of IaC state, including encryption, storage location, and access control, is a critical risk area. Although the chapters `docs/09a_security_fundamentals.md` and `docs/09b_security_patterns.md` describe best practices, they require precise source attribution to reinforce credibility and auditability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit the sections covering IaC state storage and protection within `docs/09a_security_fundamentals.md` and `docs/09b_security_patterns.md`.
- [ ] Insert explicit citations to Source [16] (and any other corroborating sources) wherever these controls are described.
- [ ] Verify that citation formatting matches the repository standard and links correctly to `docs/33_references.md`.
- [ ] Update language as required to maintain alignment with the verified factual statements.

## Additional Notes
If any statements cannot be backed by the referenced sources, adjust or remove them accordingly.
