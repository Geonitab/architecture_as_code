# Issue 19: Streamline Pipeline Validation Layer Coverage

## Priority
Low

## Type
Content structure duplication

## Component
CI/CD chapter

## Problem Statement
Chapter 5 explains fail-fast, multilayer validation in prose and then repeats the same information in a validation-layer table. The duplicated explanations provide minimal new insight and could be condensed to emphasise why the layers matter rather than what they are.

## Evidence of Repetition
- Fail-fast feedback introduction: narrative description of multilayer validation from syntax checks to security scanning.
- Validation layer table: reiterates the same layers with columns for purpose, tools, detection capabilities.

## Impact
- Reduces the impact of the table by pre-empting its content in prose form.
- Limits space for discussing trade-offs, metrics, or real-world outcomes of validation layers.
- Creates repetitive reading flow within the CI/CD chapter.

## Recommended Actions
1. Keep the structured table as the authoritative reference for validation layers.
2. Replace the introductory prose with context on why fail-fast validation delivers business value (speed, cost avoidance, risk mitigation).
3. Add examples or metrics demonstrating tangible benefits of early failure detection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Prose section rewritten to focus on rationale and outcomes rather than enumerating the same layers.
- [ ] Validation layer table retained as the primary enumeration.
- [ ] Additional examples or metrics illustrate the effectiveness of early validation.
