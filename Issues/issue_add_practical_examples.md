# Add more practical examples

## Summary
Identify the chapters where the architectural patterns would benefit from additional hands-on code samples, then outline concrete examples that demonstrate how each pattern can be applied in practice.

## Background
Readers have requested more practical guidance to accompany the conceptual explanations of each architectural pattern. Expanding the set of worked examples will strengthen the learning experience and show how the ideas translate into real systems.

## Objectives
- Review every pattern-focused chapter to spot gaps where executable examples are missing or too brief.
- Draft new examples that illustrate realistic scenarios, using the project's preferred languages and tooling.
- Highlight how each example ties back to the surrounding narrative so the new material integrates smoothly.

## Proposed Approach
1. Audit the current manuscript to catalogue the existing examples per chapter.
2. Prioritise chapters where readers will gain the most from extra samples, focusing on patterns that are conceptually dense or widely used.
3. Sketch practical scenarios that align with the problem statements already described in the book.
4. Produce code snippets and supporting explanations, validating that they compile or execute as written.
5. Update the manuscript with the new material, ensuring consistent formatting and British English spelling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A documented list of chapters earmarked for new or expanded examples, with justification for each choice.
- Draft code examples prepared for every prioritised chapter, including snippets, explanatory text, and any required assets.
- Confirmation that all examples run successfully in the project tooling or include instructions when manual setup is required.
- Updated manuscript sections demonstrating how the new examples integrate into the existing narrative.
