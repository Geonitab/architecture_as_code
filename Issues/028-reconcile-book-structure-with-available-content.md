# Reconcile outlined book structure with available manuscript content

## Summary
Address the gap between the seven-part structure promised in the introduction and the limited manuscript content currently available.

## Tasks
- [ ] Review the "How This Book Is Organised" section to identify claims that are not yet supported by existing chapters.
- [ ] Either expand the manuscript with drafted content or placeholders for Parts III through VII, or revise the introduction to mark these parts as forthcoming.
- [ ] Update navigation, tables of contents, and supporting metadata to reflect the accurate scope of available material.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The introduction accurately describes the parts and chapters that are present or clearly signals any forthcoming sections.
- Manuscript files, navigation elements, and supporting summaries do not claim coverage beyond the available content.
- Readers can distinguish between completed sections and planned future additions without ambiguity.
