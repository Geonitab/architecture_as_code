- Chapter 24 – Best Practices for Architecture as Code

## Problem Statement
Chapter 06 explains tooling options yet leaves practical guidance on large-model stewardship underdeveloped. Pain points such as workspace sprawl, DSL onboarding, and layout governance are raised without describing mitigating automation. Teams following the current material would struggle to keep diagrams aligned with evolving systems.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add step-by-step instructions for modularising large Structurizr workspaces and enforcing naming conventions.
- [ ] Provide DSL automation examples for layout templates, quality gates, and diagram versioning.
- [ ] Introduce guidance for training and adoption to prevent single-maintainer bottlenecks.
- [ ] Reference both Structurizr sources within the updated sections.
