# Issue: Harmonise Cloud Sovereignty Guidance Across Chapters 15 and 25

**Priority:** Medium
**Suggested Labels:** documentation, architecture
**Linked Finding:** EU cloud sovereignty recommendations

## Summary
Align the guidance on EU cloud sovereignty between Chapter 15 (Cost Optimisation) and Chapter 25 (Future Trends in AaC) by clarifying when to favour established hyperscalers versus sovereign initiatives.

## Background
Chapter 15 promotes AWS regions such as `eu-west-1` to satisfy GDPR-driven residency requirements and demonstrates cost-aware Terraform and Kubernetes configurations tied to major hyperscalers. Conversely, Chapter 25 encourages adoption of GAIA-X to reduce dependence on non-EU providers and achieve digital sovereignty, referencing programmes like the EU AI Act and Horizon Europe. The divergence leaves readers without a clear strategy on balancing short-term compliance with long-term sovereignty aims.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review Chapters 15 and 25 to catalogue statements about cloud provider selection, sovereignty, and compliance.
- [ ] Add an explicit comparison or bridging section that explains trade-offs between hyperscaler usage and sovereign alternatives such as GAIA-X.
- [ ] Provide guidance on transitional approaches, for example, leveraging hyperscalers for immediate compliance while planning migration paths to sovereign platforms.
- [ ] Ensure terminology and spelling conform to British English across the updated sections.

## Additional Notes
Consult subject-matter experts in cloud governance to validate the recommended scenarios and maintain factual accuracy.
