## Problem Statement
Security and automation chapters refer to infrastructure tooling but need clearer, source-backed guidance on securing pipelines and forecasting toolchain investment. The selected sources provide authoritative recommendations that should anchor pragmatic improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Update the automation and practical implementation chapters with call-out boxes that reference AWS CDK patterns for codifying guardrails.
- Expand the security fundamentals chapter with specific Terraform state hardening guidance informed by Google Cloud documentation.
- Highlight future market growth signals from MarketsandMarkets and IDC to justify continued investment in resilient toolchains.
- Ensure security pattern examples explicitly cite the relevant sources and articulate the risk mitigated by each practice.
