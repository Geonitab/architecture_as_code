# Localise Content to British English: How This Book Is Organised

The section "How This Book Is Organised" (located in 01_introduction/#how-this-book-is-organised) details the book's structure, including parts on organisation and leadership. The title uses British "Organised", but the body introduces American variants.

Specific issue: Uses "Organization" in titles/subsections instead of British "Organisation".

Example excerpt: "Part V: Organization and Leadership examines the organisational transformation, team structures, cultural shifts, and leadership practices that enable sustainable Architecture as Code adoption."

This issue tracks corrections to use "Organisation" consistently.
