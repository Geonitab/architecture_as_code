# Issue: Localise Content to British English â€“ Compliance and Quality Standards

**Section:** 04_adr/#compliance-and-quality-standards  
**Summary:** The compliance narrative promotes EU and US regulations without framing British obligations, diluting the localisation mandate.

## Observed Non-British Usage
- Highlights GDPR and PCI-DSS without acknowledging British regulatory schemes or standards.
- Implies an international context inconsistent with the book's British English orientation.
- Uses terminology that may lead readers to prioritise non-UK compliance frameworks.

## Proposed Corrections
- Rebalance the section to foreground British regulations such as the UK GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, and FCA requirements.
- Clarify when international standards remain relevant whilst maintaining British English spelling and context.
- Provide examples showcasing documentation practices tailored for British organisations.

## Tasks
- [ ] Update regulatory references to highlight British legislation and guidance.
- [ ] Ensure terminology and spellings follow British English conventions throughout the section.
- [ ] Add cross-references to British standards or government resources where applicable.
