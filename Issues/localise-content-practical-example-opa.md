# Issue: Localise Content to British English â€“ Practical Example with Open Policy Agent (OPA)

**Section:** 02_fundamental_principles/#practical-example-with-open-policy-agent-opa  
**Summary:** The practical example relies on pan-European terminology and references EU agencies, drifting from the book's British English positioning.

## Observed Non-British Usage
- Mentions "pan-European" metadata tied to ENISA and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB).
- Incorporates EU-specific acronyms without British English context, leading to a Swedish-leaning locale.
- Reinforces continental terminology that may confuse readers expecting British regulatory framing.

## Proposed Corrections
- Rephrase narrative to emphasise applicability for British organisations whilst acknowledging wider European relevance in supporting notes.
- Replace or contextualise ENISA and EDPB references with British equivalents such as the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) where appropriate.
- Audit metadata examples to ensure British English spellings and locale identifiers.

## Tasks
- [ ] Update the narrative within the section to centre on British regulatory expectations.
- [ ] Review tables or code snippets for locale-sensitive terminology and adjust to British English.
- [ ] Provide editorial notes clarifying any remaining EU agency references.
