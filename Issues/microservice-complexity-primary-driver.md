# Issue: Highlight Microservice Complexity as AaC's Primary Driver

**Priority:** High  
**Suggested Labels:** documentation, architecture  
**Linked Finding:** #6 â€“ Microservice Complexity

## Summary
Elevate the archived microservices rationale so the book's primary chapters immediately communicate that AaC addresses modern distributed system complexity.

## Background
The archived chapter `docs/archive/08_microservices.md` retains vital statistics and reasoning that explain why AaC emerged as a response to microservice sprawl. These insights currently sit outside the main narrative, diluting the opening argument. Reintegrating the most compelling evidence into the introduction and containerisation chapters will reinforce the urgency of AaC and combat the "slideware syndrome" critique.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Extract the most persuasive facts, statistics, and challenge statements from `docs/archive/08_microservices.md`.
- [ ] Update `docs/01_introduction.md` to reference microservice-induced complexity as the motivating problem statement, explicitly linking it to AaC adoption.
- [ ] Expand `docs/07_containerization.md` with a section explaining how container and microservice patterns necessitate AaC for coherence and governance.
- [ ] Ensure inserted content cites the appropriate sources already catalogued in `docs/33_references.md`.

## Additional Notes
Confirm that any references to historical anecdotes or statistics remain accurate and use British English terminology throughout.
