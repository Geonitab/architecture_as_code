# Potential contradiction regarding Documentation as Code and Architecture as Code positioning

## Summary
Chapter 1 integrates Documentation as Code into the overall Architecture as Code ecosystem, whereas Chapter 22 frames Documentation as Code and Architecture as Code as distinct practices. This issue tracks alignment of terminology and positioning so the manuscript consistently communicates their relationship.

## Tasks
- [ ] Review Chapter 1 ("Introduction to Architecture as Code") and Chapter 22 ("Documentation vs. Architecture as Code") to catalogue language that integrates or separates Documentation as Code from Architecture as Code.
- [ ] Decide whether Documentation as Code should be described as a subset of Architecture as Code or as a complementary but separate discipline, and update the chapters accordingly.
- [ ] Ensure supporting examples and descriptions in both chapters reinforce the chosen relationship and avoid contradictory reasoning.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Chapter 1 and Chapter 22 present a consistent explanation of how Documentation as Code relates to Architecture as Code.
- Any statements suggesting conflicting roles are revised or clarified with explicit context.
- Readers can clearly understand whether Documentation as Code is encompassed within Architecture as Code or operates alongside it.
