# Localise Content to British English: Styling and Themes

The section "Styling and Themes" (located in 06_structurizr/#styling-and-themes) covers customisation in Structurizr diagrams. It uses American spellings.

Specific issue: Employs "color" instead of British "colour", repeated multiple times.

Example excerpt: "element \"Person\" { shape person background #08427b color #ffffff } ..."

This issue tracks replacing "color" with "colour" throughout.
