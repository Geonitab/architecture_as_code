# Issue 18: Diversify Referenced Sources Across Chapters

## Priority
Low

## Type
Reference duplication

## Component
Source citations

## Problem Statement
ThoughtWorks’ “Architecture as Code: The Next Evolution” and Robert Martin’s “Clean Architecture” are cited in multiple chapters as generic support. The repeated use suggests a limited research base and fails to connect citations with chapter-specific arguments.

## Evidence of Repetition
- Chapter 1 cites both sources for foundational claims.
- Chapter 2 reuses the same sources alongside additional references, without clarifying their unique contribution to the new material.

## Impact
- Creates the impression of shallow or placeholder referencing.
- Undermines the credibility of claims that require specialised evidence (for example, compliance or DevOps metrics).
- Misses opportunities to showcase broader industry research.

## Recommended Actions
1. Audit each chapter to ensure citations directly support the surrounding assertions.
2. Limit reuse of foundational sources to contexts where they provide unique value.
3. Introduce domain-specific references (for example, GDPR guidance, DORA regulations, DORA metrics research) when discussing specialised topics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Citation audit completed with a mapping of sources to specific claims.
- [ ] Redundant references removed or replaced with more relevant sources.
- [ ] Chapters highlight diverse, topic-appropriate references beyond the two repeated works.

## Recommended Labels
`documentation`, `requirements`
