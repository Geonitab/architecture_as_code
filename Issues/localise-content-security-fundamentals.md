# Issue: Localise Content to British English â€“ Security Fundamentals for Architecture as Code

**Chapter:** 09a_security_fundamentals/  
**Summary:** The chapter leans heavily on US-centric frameworks such as NIST, diluting British localisation aims.

## Observed Non-British Usage
- Prominent references to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework without British context.
- American spellings and terminology when citing US publications.
- Absence of equivalent British standards, leaving a transatlantic emphasis.

## Proposed Corrections
- Introduce British frameworks and agencies (e.g., NCSC, Cyber Assessment Framework) alongside or in place of NIST references.
- Ensure all descriptive text uses British English spellings.
- Add commentary explaining international references only when necessary for comparison.

## Tasks
- [ ] Replace or contextualise US agency citations with British alternatives.
- [ ] Review the entire chapter for American spellings and adjust to British English.
- [ ] Provide updated references pointing to UK government or industry publications.
