# Issue 11: Reduce Architecture as Code Definition Redundancy

## Priority
High

## Type
Content duplication

## Component
Core definitions across multiple chapters

## Problem Statement
The core definition of Architecture as Code is repeated with near-identical wording across Chapters 1 and 2. The duplicated passages emphasise the same holistic scope (application architecture or logic, data flows, security policies, compliance rules, organisational structures) without introducing new insight, which bloats the manuscript and forces future edits to be applied in several places.

## Evidence of Repetition
- Chapter 1 – Introduction: “Architecture as Code represents a paradigm shift in system development where the entire system architecture is defined, version-controlled, and managed through code… applies the same methodologies across the whole technical landscape.”
- Chapter 1 – Evolution towards Architecture as Code: “Traditional methods… Architecture as Code builds on established principles… applies them to the complete system landscape… infrastructure, application architecture, data flows, security policies, compliance rules, organisational structures.”
- Chapter 2 – Fundamental Principles: “Architecture as Code is founded on core principles that enable successful implementation… span the entire system landscape… holistic view.”
- Chapter 2 – Holistic perspective on codification: “Architecture as Code embraces the full system ecosystem… includes application logic, data flows, security policies, compliance rules, organisational structures.”

## Impact
- Inflates chapter length without delivering new information.
- Increases maintenance overhead when terminology or scope changes.
- Creates reader fatigue by restating identical concepts.

## Recommended Actions
1. Consolidate a single authoritative definition within Chapter 1.
2. Replace later repetitions with concise cross-references (for example, “As defined in Chapter 1, Architecture as Code…”).
3. Introduce fresh insights in subsequent sections instead of restating the definition.
4. Consider adding a glossary entry to centralise recurring terminology.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Chapter 1 contains one comprehensive definition that is referenced elsewhere.
- [ ] Repeated paragraphs in Chapters 1 and 2 are replaced with cross-references or unique context.
- [ ] Editorial review confirms no redundant copies of the definition remain.
