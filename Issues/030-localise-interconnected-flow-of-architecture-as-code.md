# Localise Content to British English: The Interconnected Flow of Architecture as Code

The section "The Interconnected Flow of Architecture as Code" (located in 01_introduction/#the-interconnected-flow-of-architecture-as-code) describes how various elements of Architecture as Code interconnect, including Management as Code for organisational policies. It mixes British and American spellings.

Specific issue: Uses "organization" in the chapter context instead of British "organisation".

Example excerpt: "Management as Code integrates leadership practices, governance routines, and strategic decision-making into the same version-controlled ecosystem, ensuring that organisational policies and management intent are codified alongside technical implementations."

This issue tracks updates to standardise on British English, replacing "organization" with "organisation" where appropriate.
