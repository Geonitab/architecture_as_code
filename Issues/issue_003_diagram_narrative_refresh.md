## Problem Statement
Diagram automation guidance references C4 practices and CALM principles but does not clearly show how modern cloud-native adoption pressures make structured diagrams indispensable. The narrative needs to bridge the industry adoption data with the practical Structurizr walkthrough so that readers understand why consistent modelling languages matter for large portfolios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integrate CNCF cloud-native adoption data into the diagram automation chapter to frame the urgency for consistent models.
- [ ] Reinforce how CALM vocabulary informs the examples and figure captions presented in the Structurizr chapter.
- [ ] Ensure best-practice guidance signposts readers from conceptual models to automated tooling examples without leaving gaps.
