# Enforce Diagram Legibility Limits

## Summary
Ensure every diagram contains no more than 15 elements to maintain readability, splitting diagrams when necessary.

## Tasks
- Review all diagrams and count their visual elements (nodes, bars, slices, etc.).
- Identify diagrams exceeding the 15-element threshold.
- Propose and implement splits or redesigns for diagrams with too many elements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No single diagram contains more than 15 elements.
- Replacement diagrams preserve the original information while improving clarity.
