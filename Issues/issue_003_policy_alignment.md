- Chapter 11: Governance as Code (`docs/11_governance_as_code.md`)
- Chapter 23: Software as Code Interplay (`docs/23_soft_as_code_interplay.md`)

## Problem Statement
Platform teams manage multiple policy engines—Sentinel, OPA, and bespoke scripts—without a unifying governance standard. The book positions policy as code as an essential discipline for secure operations, but the repository does not yet include comparative guidance or reusable controls to harmonise approaches.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Produce a cross-platform policy guide summarising shared controls and how they surface in Terraform, Kubernetes, and application pipelines.
- Provide reference implementations demonstrating GitLab-driven compliance automation informed by the highlighted research.
- Update governance chapters with links to living policy catalogues and escalation workflows maintained in the repository.
