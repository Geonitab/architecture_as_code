## Problem Statement
Chapters covering governance and state management outline strong conceptual principles but lack actionable issue templates for backlog management. Without curated issues, delivery teams struggle to translate guidance on policy-as-code, secure state backends, and cross-cloud guardrails into iterative work. This gap prevents consistent adoption of the controls described in the manuscript.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A cross-cloud backlog that sequences the implementation of secure Terraform state storage for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, each with policy-as-code validation gates.
- Acceptance tests defined for each work item to confirm encryption, role separation, and automated policy evaluation are in place.
- Documentation tasks identified so that updated governance runbooks reference the live policy-as-code artefacts.
- Measurement of governance coverage captured as Definition of Done notes to maintain transparency for auditors and platform stakeholders.
