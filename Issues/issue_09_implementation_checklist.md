- [ ] ‚è≥ Demonstrate comparable functionality
- [ ] ‚è≥ Highlight testing differences
- [ ] ‚è≥ Add GDPR/compliance elements (EU focus)
- [ ] ‚è≥ Test code examples for correctness
- [ ] ‚è≥ Add cross-references from Chapter 13

**Estimated effort:** 3-4 hours

### 2.3 Cross-Reference to Related Issues
**Target:** Multiple locations

- [ ] ‚è≥ Link to testable-iac-practical-execution.md recommendations

## Phase 3: Quality Assurance

### 3.1 Consistency Review

- [ ] ‚è≥ Verify British English throughout all additions
- [ ] ‚è≥ Check tone consistency with existing manuscript
- [ ] ‚è≥ Validate technical accuracy
- [ ] ‚è≥ Ensure balanced presentation (not favoring any tool)
