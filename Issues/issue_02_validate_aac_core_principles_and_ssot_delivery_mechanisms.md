# Issue 2: Validate AaC Core Principles and SSOT Delivery Mechanisms

## Source IDs
[2], [9]

## Relevant Manuscript Sections
Sections 1.2.1 and 2.2.2 covering Adoptability, Extensibility, and Productivity, plus the discussion of AaC as a Single Source of Truth (SSOT).

## Problem Statement
Verify that the manuscript's portrayal of AaC's core principles matches Source [2] and that Source [9] is correctly used to emphasise SSOT responsibilities and interfaces (CLI/API).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Cross-check each principle's description with the wording and nuance from Source [2].
- Confirm that the SSOT section mentions both CLI and API interfaces when referencing Source [9].
- Flag any missing attributes or misaligned terminology and suggest precise wording adjustments.
