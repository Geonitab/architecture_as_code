# Issue 12: Replace Nominalisations with Active Verbs

## Relevant Documentation Sections
Architecture as Code manuscript, especially chapters covering ADR practices, governance mechanisms, and tooling discussions.

## Problem Statement
The narrative frequently converts verbs into nouns (for example, "facilitates knowledge transfer"), creating distant, formal prose that obscures the actor. This nominalisation-heavy style makes it harder for readers to identify who performs an action and adds unnecessary complexity to simple statements.

## Impact
- Readers struggle to trace accountability for activities.
- Sentences become longer and more bureaucratic in tone.
- Excess formality erodes the accessible, practitioner-focused voice we target for the book.

## Recommended Remediation
- Rewrite affected sentences with strong verbs and explicit subjects (for example, "teams transfer knowledge").
- Audit ADR and governance sections where process descriptions are dense and convert nominalisations to active voice.
- Ensure resulting sentences remain concise and aligned with British English phrasing conventions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Affected sections use active verbs with clear subjects instead of abstract nouns.
- Updated copy reads more directly while preserving the intended meaning.
- Editorial spot-checks confirm improved clarity in all highlighted examples and analogous passages.
