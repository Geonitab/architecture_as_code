# Issue 4: Clarify AaC vs. IaC Abstraction and Opinionation

## Source IDs
[4], [14]

## Relevant Manuscript Sections
Section 3.1.2, including the comparison table contrasting AaC and IaC.

## Problem Statement
Validate that Source [4] supports the need for opinionated governance at the architectural level and that Source [14] substantiates the move toward higher-level abstractions (e.g., AWS CDK) bridging IaC and AaC.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Confirm the table's description of abstraction levels and governance aligns with Source [4]'s commentary on opinionated tooling.
- Verify that Source [14] is cited where the manuscript discusses IaC tools adopting higher-level constructs akin to AaC.
- Document any misinterpretations and supply corrected phrasing or additional citations if required.
