- Chapter 22 – Documentation as Code vs Architecture as Code

## Problem Statement
Chapter 02 catalogues historical drift but stops short of prescribing enforceable countermeasures. Sections covering model-driven development and manual governance describe failure modes yet do not direct readers towards source-controlled documentation or branching strategies that prevent regression. Without actionable practices the chapter risks sounding observational rather than guiding teams to maintain long-lived artefacts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Introduce clear recommendations for storing architectural artefacts in version control and reviewing them alongside code.
- [ ] Provide practical workflow examples (e.g. trunk-based or GitFlow adaptations) that counter the drift scenarios documented.
- [ ] Cross-reference documentation-as-code techniques to demonstrate how narrative and diagrams stay synchronised.
- [ ] Ensure cited sources are acknowledged in the updated text.
