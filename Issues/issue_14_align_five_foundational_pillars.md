# Issue 14: Align the Five Foundational Pillars Narrative

## Priority
Medium

## Type
Structural inconsistency

## Component
Core principles definition

## Problem Statement
Chapter 2 references “five foundational pillars” twice, but the introductory list (declarative code, version control, automation, reproducibility, scalability) does not match the subsequent section headings (declarative definition, holistic perspective, immutable patterns, testability, documentation as code). The mismatch leaves readers unsure which constructs are canonical.

## Evidence of Inconsistency
- Opening description ties the pillars to declarative code → version control → automation → reproducibility → scalability.
- Section breakdown covers different topics, omitting version control and scalability while adding holistic perspective and documentation as code.

## Impact
- Erodes trust in the manuscript’s core framework.
- Makes it difficult to reference “the five pillars” consistently.
- Introduces ambiguity for diagrams, summaries, or cross-references relying on the pillar concept.

## Recommended Actions
1. Define a single authoritative list of the five pillars, with unambiguous names.
2. Update Chapter 2 structure so each section corresponds to one pillar.
3. Ensure diagrams, summaries, and subsequent chapters reference the same pillar names.
4. Provide brief rationale for each pillar to reinforce their distinct contribution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Canonical pillar list documented and agreed by the editorial team.
- [ ] Chapter 2 headings revised to match the canonical list.
- [ ] Supporting diagrams or call-outs updated for consistency.
- [ ] Cross-references audited to confirm they align with the revised pillar names.

## Recommended Labels
`documentation`, `architecture`
