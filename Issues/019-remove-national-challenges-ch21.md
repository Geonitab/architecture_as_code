# Remove national challenges in Chapter 21: Digitalisation and Enterprise Strategy

## Summary
Reframe Chapter 21 strategy content to emphasise EU-wide compliance and collaboration rather than Swedish-specific challenges.

## Tasks
- [ ] Update references to Swedish GDPR and NIS2 challenges with European-level governance bodies such as the EDPB.

- [ ] Ensure strategy recommendations address pan-European digitalisation initiatives.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Content aligns with EU-wide strategies and regulatory expectations.
- No country-specific examples or assumptions remain in the chapter.
- Regional guidance is generic and applicable across EU member states.
