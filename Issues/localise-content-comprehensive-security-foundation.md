# Issue: Localise Content to British English â€“ Comprehensive Security Foundation Module

**Section:** 09b_security_patterns/#comprehensive-security-foundation-module  
**Summary:** Commentary within the module references Swedish security expectations, undermining British localisation.

## Observed Non-British Usage
- Inline comments cite "Swedish security expectations".
- Suggests compliance targets unique to Sweden.
- Omits British or neutral framing for rotation policies.

## Proposed Corrections
- Reword comments to focus on British operational expectations or general best practice.
- Align supporting text with British English spellings and regulatory references.
- Introduce UK-centric rotation standards where available.

## Tasks
- [ ] Replace Swedish references with British or universally applicable terminology.
- [ ] Ensure documentation uses British spelling and context.
- [ ] Validate that code examples demonstrate suitability for British organisations.
