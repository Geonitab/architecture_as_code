## Relevant Manuscript Sections
- Chapter 04 â€“ Architecture Decision Records

## Problem Statement
Current ADR coverage explains the concept but does not provide sustained operational guidance. There is little discussion of review cadences, traceability automation, or integrating ADRs with architectural dashboards. As a result, decisions risk becoming stale text rather than living artefacts that shepherd maintainable systems.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Expand the ADR workflow description to include discovery, review, and supersession processes managed through code.
- [ ] Demonstrate how ADR metadata can power automated governance dashboards or change logs.
- [ ] Add examples showing how ADRs prevent knowledge loss during staff turnover.
- [ ] Reference the supporting sources within the enriched narrative.
