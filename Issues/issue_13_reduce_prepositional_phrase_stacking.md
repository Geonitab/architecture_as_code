# Issue 13: Reduce Prepositional Phrase Stacking

## Relevant Documentation Sections
Architecture as Code manuscript narrative chapters and supporting documentation describing workflows and governance.

## Problem Statement
Many sentences layer three or more prepositional phrases (for example, "practice of describing, version-controlling, and automating the entire system architecture through machine-readable code"). This stacking bloats sentences, forcing readers to parse long strings of modifiers before reaching the main clause.

## Impact
- Readers need to re-read sentences to grasp the core idea.
- The prose feels bureaucratic and detached.
- Dense constructions reduce accessibility for practitioners scanning for practical guidance.

## Recommended Remediation
- Limit sentences to two prepositional phrases wherever feasible.
- Convert prepositional phrases into adjectives or adverbs when the meaning stays intact.
- Prioritise strong subjects and verbs early in each sentence to anchor the reader.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Revised sections present core ideas within two prepositional phrases or fewer per sentence.
- Key examples highlighted in the issue description read cleanly with minimal structural repetition.
- Editorial sampling across documentation confirms improved flow without information loss.
