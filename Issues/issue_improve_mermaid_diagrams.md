# Improve Mermaid diagrams

## Summary
Review the current Mermaid diagrams and refine their structure, styling, and annotations so the visuals communicate each architectural concept clearly and consistently.

## Background
Several diagrams have evolved organically as the manuscript expanded, leading to inconsistencies in layout, labelling, and readability. A focused clean-up will make the visuals easier to interpret and align them with the design guidance already established for the book.

## Objectives
- Evaluate every Mermaid source file to identify confusing layouts, ambiguous labels, or outdated patterns.
- Apply consistent styling conventions for fonts, colours, spacing, and alignment, following the design system guidance.
- Update diagram narratives in the manuscript to reflect any visual changes that improve clarity.

## Proposed Approach
1. Catalogue the current diagrams, noting any readability or accuracy concerns.
2. Compare each diagram against the design system guidelines to highlight deviations.
3. Revise the Mermaid source files to simplify flows, clarify relationships, and standardise styling tokens.
4. Regenerate the PNG assets and confirm they render correctly in all distribution formats.
5. Coordinate with editorial reviewers to ensure the updated diagrams reinforce the surrounding text.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A tracked list of diagrams audited, including the adjustments made for each asset.
- Updated Mermaid source files that follow the agreed design conventions and render without errors.
- Regenerated diagram assets committed alongside the source updates.
- Manuscript excerpts reviewed to ensure textual references to diagrams remain accurate.

## Suggested Labels
- `design`
