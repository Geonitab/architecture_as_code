# Issue: Localise Content to British English â€“ AI-Augmented Infrastructure Optimisation

**Section:** 12_compliance/#ai-augmented-infrastructure-optimisation  
**Summary:** The optimisation narrative mixes spellings and hints at American variants, risking inconsistency within British English sections.

## Observed Non-British Usage
- Contextual commentary mentions "optimize" whilst the code uses `optimise`.
- Supporting text references American spelling in surrounding prose or comments.
- Inconsistent terminology may confuse readers about the preferred British spelling.

## Proposed Corrections
- Standardise all surrounding prose, comments, and variable names to British spellings (`optimise`, `optimisation`).
- Verify that any imported modules or helper functions follow the same convention.
- Provide an editorial note emphasising British English spelling for automation terminology.

## Tasks
- [ ] Review the section for stray American spellings of "optimise/optimisation" and correct them.
- [ ] Align docstrings and comments with British English usage.
- [ ] Confirm glossary entries reinforce British terminology for optimisation routines.
