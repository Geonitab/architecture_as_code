# Issue #564 Verification: Containerization Chapter British English Status

## Summary

Issue #564 claims that the chapter "Containerization and Orchestration as Code" (docs/07_containerization.md) contains American English spellings that need to be converted to British English. 

**Verification Result**: The file already uses British English consistently throughout. No changes are required.

## Analysis

### British English Spellings Found (Correct)

The file correctly uses British English spellings:

- **Line 5**: "data centres" (not "data centers")
- **Line 9**: "behaviour" (not "behavior")  
- **Line 21**: "organisational" (not "organizational")
- **Line 29**: "standardised" (not "standardized")
- **Line 37**: "organisations" (not "organizations")
- **Line 37**: "standardising" (not "standardizing")
- **Line 235**: "organisations" (not "organizations")

### American English Spellings Checked (None Found)

Comprehensive checks were performed for common American spelling patterns:

- ❌ **-ize endings**: No incorrect usage (only "size: 10Gi" in YAML config)
- ❌ **-or instead of -our**: No instances found (correctly uses "behaviour")
- ❌ **-er instead of -re**: No instances found (no "center", "meter", etc.)
- ❌ **-yze instead of -yse**: No instances found
- ❌ **-og instead of -ogue**: No instances found  
- ❌ **-ense instead of -ence**: No instances found
- ❌ **American doubled consonants**: No instances found

## Conclusion

The containerization chapter (docs/07_containerization.md) is **already fully compliant** with British English standards. Issue #564 appears to be based on an incorrect assessment.

**Recommendation**: Close issue #564 as invalid or already resolved. PR #584 was correctly closed with no changes because no changes were needed.
