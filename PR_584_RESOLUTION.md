# Resolution Summary: PR #584 and Issue #564

## Issue Context

- **Issue #564**: Claimed that `docs/07_containerization.md` contains American English that needs conversion to British English
- **PR #584**: Created to fix issue #564, but was closed because no files were changed
- **Current Issue**: Fix why PR #584 had no changes

## Root Cause Analysis

PR #584 was correctly closed with no changes because:

1. The file `docs/07_containerization.md` **already uses British English consistently**
2. Issue #564's premise was incorrect - there were no American spellings to convert
3. The previous Copilot agent correctly identified there was nothing to change

## Evidence

The containerization chapter uses proper British English throughout:

| Line | British English Used | American Alternative |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 5 | "data centres" | ✗ "data centers" |
| 9 | "behaviour" | ✗ "behavior" |
| 21 | "organisational" | ✗ "organizational" |
| 29 | "standardised" | ✗ "standardized" |
| 37, 235 | "organisations" | ✗ "organizations" |

Comprehensive scanning found **zero instances** of American spelling patterns:
- No `-ize` endings (except technical "size" in YAML)
- No `-or` endings where `-our` is required
- No `-er` endings where `-re` is required  
- No `-yze` endings where `-yse` is required

## Resolution

This PR provides verification documentation (`ISSUE_564_VERIFICATION.md`) proving that:

1. The file is already compliant with British English requirements
2. PR #584 was correctly closed with no changes
3. Issue #564 should be closed as invalid/already resolved

## Recommendation

Close issue #564 with a comment referencing the verification document, explaining that the chapter is already fully compliant with British English standards.
