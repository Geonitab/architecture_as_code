<h2 id="how-to-use-this-glossary">How to use this glossary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start with the diagram:</strong> The class diagram summarises how foundational Architecture as Code elements interact. Trace the relationships before diving into the definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Explore by theme:</strong> Terms are grouped so product teams, platform engineers, security specialists, and organisational leaders can quickly find language relevant to their responsibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference chapters:</strong> Each definition reflects the terminology used throughout the book. When you see a highlighted concept in other chapters, return here for a concise explanation.</li>
<li><strong>Keep language inclusive:</strong> Use these definitions when collaborating so every team member hears consistent, people-first language.</li>

<thead>
<tr>
<th>Term</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Architecture as Code</td>
<td>Treating architectural decisions, guardrails, and platform capabilities as versioned artefacts that are reviewed, tested, and deployed through automated pipelines. Often abbreviated as AaC.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Infrastructure as Code</td>
<td>A practice closely related to AaC where infrastructure resources are defined declaratively and managed through version control to deliver predictable environments. Frequently shortened to IaC.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Architecture Decision Record</td>
<td>A lightweight document that captures context, decision, and consequences so teams understand why architectural choices were made and can revisit them together. Commonly known as an ADR.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Declarative Programming</td>
<td>A style of describing desired outcomes rather than procedural steps, enabling automation tools to converge systems on the target state reliably.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Idempotence</td>
<td>The property that a command or template can run repeatedly with the same end result, protecting teams from accidental drift or double execution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reusable Module</td>
<td>A parameterised building block—such as a Terraform module or Helm chart—that encapsulates best practice and is published for teams to compose new solutions quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>API</td>
<td>An application programming interface (API) is a contract that allows systems to interact predictably, enabling modular architectures and integrated delivery workflows.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery</td>
<td>A feedback-driven workflow where code changes are integrated, tested, and promoted through automated stages, reducing manual handovers. Teams usually refer to this as CI/CD.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delivery Pipeline</td>
<td>The orchestrated flow of automated checks, approvals, and deployments that transform committed code into resilient production services.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Version Control System</td>
<td>A collaborative platform—Git being the most common—that stores source code, policies, and templates, preserving history and peer review. Often shortened to VCS.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GitOps</td>
<td>Operating models that use a VCS as the single source of truth so that merges trigger automated reconciliation against live environments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Configuration Management</td>
<td>Tooling such as Ansible or Chef that applies desired system states, often working alongside declarative templates to maintain consistency.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Terraform</td>
<td>A widely used IaC tool that compiles declarative configurations into API calls, offering modular composition and policy enforcement hooks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Helm</td>
<td>The package manager for Kubernetes that bundles manifests, default values, and documentation into shareable charts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubernetes</td>
<td>An open-source orchestration platform that schedules containers, scales workloads, and standardises operational tasks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Container</td>
<td>A lightweight, portable runtime package that combines application code with dependencies for consistent execution across environments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service Mesh</td>
<td>A dedicated infrastructure layer that manages service-to-service security, routing, and observability without each team writing bespoke logic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Runbook Automation</td>
<td>Automated execution of the procedural knowledge once held in runbooks, shortening incident response while keeping humans in control of critical decisions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Observability Stack</td>
<td>The telemetry pipelines, dashboards, and alerting rules that provide actionable insight into system behaviour and guide inclusive on-call collaboration.</td>

<tr>
<td>Continuous Compliance</td>
<td>Automated validation that checks regulatory and internal controls with every change, generating evidence that auditors and teams can trust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zero Trust</td>
<td>A security stance that continuously verifies identities, device health, and context before granting access, reducing implicit trust between services.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Security Policy</td>
<td>A codified set of safeguards—identity, encryption, network, and data-handling—that shapes how architecture components interoperate securely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data Sovereignty</td>
<td>Ensuring data is handled in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, influencing design choices and deployment regions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Risk Assessment Matrix</td>
<td>A structured view of likelihood versus impact that helps teams evaluate and prioritise mitigations collaboratively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Access Federation</td>
<td>Coordinated identity management across platforms so that people have the least-privileged access they need to perform their roles.</td>

<tr>
<td>Service Level Objective</td>
<td>A shared target for reliability, expressed as a measurable goal that teams use to evaluate whether customer expectations are being met. Commonly called an SLO.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service Level Indicator</td>
<td>The quantitative measurement—such as latency or error rate—that shows whether an SLO is being achieved. Frequently described as an SLI.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Error Budget</td>
<td>The agreed allowance for unreliability that guides deployment pace and prioritisation of improvement work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chaos Engineering</td>

<p>Keeping the glossary actionable requires more than prose. A structured dataset now lives at <code>references/glossary_terms_relationships.json</code> so automation can reason about how concepts reinforce one another. Pipelines use it to surface dependencies in pull requests, populate architecture decision templates, and keep presentation material aligned with the book’s vocabulary.</p>
