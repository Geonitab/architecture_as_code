<h2 id="maturity-model-for-implementing-architecture-as-code">Maturity model for implementing architecture as code</h2>
<p>Modern organisations are increasingly turning to <strong>architecture as code (AaC)</strong> to keep systems design, security and governance aligned with rapid delivery.<br />
The <em>Architecture as Code</em> book describes how codified representations of architecture, policy, governance and even cultural knowledge share common traits:<br />
they use machine-readable formats, live in version control and are automatically validated.  </p>
<p>This maturity model synthesises those insights into staged levels of adoption.
It recognises that organisations progress from ad-hoc scripting and isolated diagrams to integrated, self-optimising systems that manage compliance, governance and knowledge via code.</p>
<h2 id="interactive-radar-assessment">Interactive radar assessment</h2>
<p>For an interactive experience that mirrors the full questionnaire and generates a downloadable radar chart, use the <a href="../maturity_model_radar.html">Architecture as Code maturity radar tool</a>. The tool captures every checklist question from this appendix, visualises the current capabilities and produces prioritised improvement guidance that can be shared across teams.</p>
<h2 id="staircase-overview-of-maturity-progression">Staircase overview of maturity progression</h2>
<p><img alt="Architecture as Code maturity staircase highlighting Levels 0 to 5" src="images/diagram_32_maturity_model.png" /></p>
<p>The staircase presents the progression from manually curated architecture artefacts to adaptive, AI-supported operating models. Each step emphasises the primary enabler that unlocks the next maturity level.</p>

<h2 id="dimensions-and-as-code-aspects">Dimensions and “as code” aspects</h2>
<p>The maturity model includes the key “as code” disciplines discussed in the book:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Architecture as Code is more than diagrams — it is a holistic approach that unifies infrastructure, policy, governance, documentation and culture through codified representations.<br />
By progressing through this maturity model, organisations can evolve from manual, error‑prone processes to adaptive systems that embed governance and leverage AI for continuous improvement.  </p>
<p>“As code” disciplines must reinforce one another rather than exist in silos.</p>
