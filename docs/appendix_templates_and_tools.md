# Templates and Tools Appendix

The Architecture as Code programme includes a collection of reusable templates and interactive tools that complement the core chapters. Use this appendix to locate the supporting artefacts, understand when to apply them, and link them into your own governance repositories.

## Architecture as Code Maturity Model

The [Architecture as Code Maturity Model](architecture_as_code_maturity_model.md) summarises capability levels across people, process, and technology dimensions. Pair it with the radar visualisation to communicate progress with leadership teams and identify the next improvements.

## Maturity Radar Visualisation

The [Maturity Radar Tool](maturity_model_radar.html) renders the maturity data as an interactive chart for workshops. Export the radar and embed it into review packs so stakeholders can track trends each quarter.

## Control Mapping Matrix Template

The [Control Mapping Matrix Template](appendix_f_control_mapping_matrix_template.md) provides a ready-made structure for cataloguing how each control maps to ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST 800-53, GDPR, and internal policies. Reference it from evidence pipelines so that every assurance artefact links back to the relevant obligations.

## Additional Assets

- [FINOS Project Blueprint Guide](32_finos_project_blueprint.md): Implementation guide for regulated environments using Project Blueprint.
- `templates/` directory: Source files for workshops, diagrams, and supplementary assets distributed with the book.

Bring these resources into your documentation portal to accelerate onboarding and maintain a consistent toolkit across teams.
