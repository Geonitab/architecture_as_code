# Templates and Tools for Architecture as Code Programmes

This appendix curates reusable templates and accelerators that help delivery teams adopt Architecture as Code practices without
recreating foundational material. Each artefact aligns with the British English editorial guidance used throughout the
manuscript and links to living sources in this repository so organisations can extend them in their own governance platforms.

## Architecture as Code Maturity Model

The [Architecture as Code Maturity Model](architecture_as_code_maturity_model.md) provides a staged view of capability
development. Use the radar to benchmark current practices, identify the next set of improvements, and articulate measurable
outcomes for executive sponsors. The maturity model doubles as a change-management tool, highlighting the dependencies between
architecture as code, policy as code, and evidence as code disciplines.

## Control Mapping Matrix Template

The [Control Mapping Matrix Template](appendix_c_control_mapping_matrix_template.md) helps compliance and platform teams capture
a single, auditable catalogue of assurance evidence. Populate the template with control identifiers, framework references, and
links to machine-generated artefacts so that auditors, risk partners, and engineering teams can trace coverage in one location.
Aligning the matrix with evidence manifests ensures that "assure once, comply many" becomes a repeatable delivery principle.

## Additional Templates and Automations

Beyond the core appendices, the `templates/` directory contains supplementary examples, such as
Structurizr models, ADR scaffolding, and compliance workflows. Treat these assets as starter kits: fork them into your own
repositories, codify organisation-specific policies, and contribute improvements back through pull requests.
