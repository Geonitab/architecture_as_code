### Archived Drafts

The `archive/` folder stores markdown chapters that have been retired from the active manuscript. These files are excluded from the automated build sequence in `build_book.sh` but remain available for reference and future revisions.

| File | Original Chapter | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| `archive/cloud_architecture.md` | Chapter 6 (Swedish draft) | Superseded by the current English material covering cloud-native execution. |
| `archive/microservices_architecture_en.md` | Chapter 8 translation | Retained as a translation reference after the live chapter was rewritten. |
| `archive/lovable_mockups_sv.md` | Chapter 20 workshop | Vendor-specific Swedish workshop material preserved for future localisation work. |
| `archive/future_trends_sv.md` | Chapter 25 draft | Swedish-language narrative replaced by the live Chapter 25. |
| `archive/future_development_sv.md` | Chapter 26 companion | Swedish continuation of future-planning material folded into later revisions. |

Archive filenames intentionally avoid numeric prefixes so that tooling can distinguish archived content from active chapters.

## Book Organisation Principles

The book's seven-part structure follows a logical progression:

1. **Part 1: Foundations** – Establishes core concepts and principles that underpin Architecture as Code work
2. **Part 2: Architecture Platform** – Builds the technical capabilities required for codified architecture
3. **Part 3: Security & Governance** – Ensures safety, control, and regulatory alignment
4. **Part 4: Delivery & Operations** – Provides the practices needed to deliver and operate architecture as code
5. **Part 5: Organisation & Leadership** – Aligns teams, leadership, and collaboration models with the new operating model
6. **Part 6: Experience & Best Practices** – Shares cross-disciplinary experiences and lessons learned
7. **Part 7: Future & Wrap-up** – Explores the future direction and concludes the narrative, supported by appendices

This structure ensures:
- **Logical progression**: Each part builds upon knowledge from previous parts
- **Thematic grouping**: Related topics are covered together for better comprehension
- **Balance**: Theory and practice are balanced throughout all parts
- **Adaptability**: Guidance is written for international applicability with notes for adapting to local regulatory requirements

## Diagrams and Images

The `images/` directory contains:
- **Mermaid files** (`.mmd`): Source code for diagrams that are automatically converted to PNG
- **PNG files** (`.png`): Generated diagram images used in the book

Each chapter has associated diagrams that illustrate key concepts and processes.

## Build Process

The book is built automatically through:

1. **Diagram generation**: Mermaid diagrams are converted to PNG images
2. **PDF generation**: All chapters are combined into a complete PDF using Pandoc
3. **Version control**: The entire process is version controlled via Git

### Local Building

```bash
# Build the complete book
cd docs
./build_book.sh
```

### CI/CD

The book is built automatically when changes are made to the `docs/` directory through GitHub Actions.

## Target Audience

This book is intended for:
- IT architects and system designers
- DevOps engineers and infrastructure specialists
- Developers working with cloud technologies
- Technology leaders and decision makers
- Project managers for digitalisation initiatives

## Authors and Contributors

See `29_about_the_authors.md` for detailed information about the book's author and the expertise behind this comprehensive guide.
