# Architecture as Code Maturity Radar Tool

The Architecture as Code Maturity Radar is delivered as an interactive HTML experience that mirrors the full questionnaire captured in Appendix G. It guides organisations through the adoption staircase, visualises strengths and gaps, and produces prioritised improvement recommendations.

## Accessing the interactive tool

The radar tool loads from the HTML implementation maintained alongside this appendix. Open [the interactive radar experience](appendix_h_maturity_model_radar.html) in a web browser to:

- Capture the complete readiness questionnaire across infrastructure, governance, compliance, testing, and knowledge management themes.
- Generate a downloadable radar chart that highlights capability maturity across the ten Architecture as Code dimensions.
- Export prioritised recommendations that align with the adoption guidance described in [Appendix G](appendix_g_architecture_as_code_maturity_model.md).

## Using the tool alongside the book

- Complete the questionnaire after each major iteration to monitor progress and focus investment.
- Share the generated radar visualisation with leadership stakeholders to maintain alignment on transformation priorities.
- Revisit the tool when new teams join the programme so onboarding workshops focus on the lowest-maturity capabilities.

The HTML version remains under version control so improvements to scoring logic, visual styling, or export formats can be tracked and reviewed just like any other artefact in this repository.
