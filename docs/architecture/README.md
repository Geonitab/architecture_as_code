# Architecture Bot Responses

This directory stores markdown outlines generated by the automated architect bot
workflow defined in `.github/workflows/architect-bot.yml`. Each file corresponds
to an issue that was labeled with `architecture` and contains a structured
response that can be refined into a pull request delivering the requested
change. The markdown is produced by `scripts/architect_bot.py`.

Files follow the pattern `ISSUEID-slug.md` and can be updated by contributors as
the solution matures.
