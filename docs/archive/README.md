# Archived Book Drafts

This folder stores manuscript material that no longer belongs to the primary 31-chapter structure described in `docs/book_structure.md`. Files kept here remain valuable reference drafts but are excluded from automated builds (`docs/build_book.sh`) so that only the canonical chapters are rendered.

## Current Contents

- `06_cloud_architecture.md` – Original Swedish manuscript for Chapter 6. Retained for reference after the chapter was retired from the active book sequence.
- `06_cloud_architecture_en.md` – British English translation of the retired Chapter 6, kept alongside the Swedish source for archival completeness.
- `32_code_oriented_organisations.md` – Previously labelled as Chapter 32. The narrative overlaps with other organisational guidance and is now preserved as optional background reading.

When reviving or replacing an archived chapter, move it back to the `docs/` root and update `docs/build_book.sh` plus the table of contents to reintroduce it into the publication workflow.
