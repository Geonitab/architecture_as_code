# Containerisering and orkestrering as code

![Containerisering and orkestrering](images/diagram_11_kapitel10.png)

Architecture as Code-methodologyen utgör grunden for containerteknologi and orkestrering representerar paradigmskifte in how applikationer driftsätts and skalas. Through to definiera Architecture as Code for containrar enabless portabel, skalbar and reproducerbar applikationsdeployment over olika miljöer and molnleverantörer.

## Container-teknologiens roll within Architecture as Code

Containers erbjuder application-level virtualization that paketerar applikationer with all dependencies in isolated, portable units. For Architecture as Code innebär This to application deployment can standardiseras and is automated through code-based definitions that ensures consistency between development, testing and production environbutts.

Docker have etablerat sig that de facto standard for containerization, while podman andra alternativ erbjuder daemon-less approaches for enhanced security. Container images is defined through Dockerfiles that executable infrastructure code, vilket enables version control and automated building of application artifacts.

Container registries fungerar that centralized repositories for image distribution and versioning. Private registries ensures corporate security requirebutts, while image scanning and vulnerability assessbutt integreras in CI/CD pipelines for automated security validation before deployment.

## Kubernetes that orchestration platform

Kubernetes have emergerat that leading container orchestration platform through dess declarative configuration model and extensive ecosystem. YAML-based manifests definierar desired state for applications, services, and infrastructure components, vilket alignar perfekt with Architecture as Code principles.

Kubernetes objects that Deploybutts, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets enables comprehensive application lifecycle managebutt through code. Pod specifications, resource quotas, network policies, and persistent volume claims can all is defined declaratively and managed through version control systems.

Helm charts extend Kubernetes capabilities through templating and package managebutt for complex applications. Chart repositories enable reusable infrastructure patterns and standardized deployment procedures across different environbutts and organizational units.

## Service mesh and advanced networking

Service mesh architectures that Istio and Linkerd is implebutted through Infrastructure as Code for to hantera inter-service communication, security policies, and observability. These platforms abstract networking complexity from application developers while providing fine-grained control through configuration files.

Traffic managebutt policies is defined as code for load balancing, circuit breaking, retry mechanisms, and canary deployments. Security policies for mutual TLS, access control, and authentication/authorization can be version controlled and automatically applied across service topologies.

Observability configurations for tracing, metrics collection, and logging integration managed through declarative specifications. This enables comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities while maintaining consistency across distributed service architectures.

## Infrastructure automation with container platforms

Architecture as Code-principlesna within This område

Container-native infrastructure tools that Crossplane and Operator Framework extend Kubernetes for complete infrastructure managebutt. These platforms enables provisioning and managebutt of cloud reSources through Kubernetes-native APIs and custom resource definitions.

GitOps workflows implebutt continuous delivery for both applications and infrastructure through Git repositories that single source of truth. Tools that ArgoCD and Flux automate deployment processes through continuous monitoring of Git state and automatic reconciliation of cluster state.

Multi-cluster managebutt platforms centralize policy enforcebutt, resource allocation, and governance across distributed Kubernetes environbutts. Federation and cluster API specifications standardize cluster lifecycle managebutt through declarative configurations.

## Persistent storage and data managebutt

Persistent volume managebutt for containerized applications kräver careful consideration of performance, availability, and backup requirebutts. Storage classes and persistent volume claims is defined as infrastructure code for automated provisioning and lifecycle managebutt.

Database operators for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, andra systems enable database-as-code deployment patterns. These operators handle complex operations that backup scheduling, high availability configuration, and automated recovery through custom resource definitions.

Data protection strategies is implebutted through backup operators and disaster recovery procedures definierade as code. This ensures consistent data protection policies across environbutts and automated recovery capabilities during incidents.
