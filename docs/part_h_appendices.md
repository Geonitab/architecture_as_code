# Part H: Appendices and Reference

The appendices provide essential reference material, technical implementations, and background context that complement the main narrative. These resources support practitioners as they apply Architecture as Code principles in their own environments.

The [glossary](28_glossary.md) defines key terms and concepts used throughout this book, providing clarity on terminology that may have different interpretations across contexts. Understanding this shared vocabulary ensures clear communication when teams discuss Architecture as Code practices.

[About the Authors](29_about_the_authors.md) provides context for the expertise and perspectives that shaped this book, helping readers understand the experiences and principles that inform the guidance offered.

[Appendix A: Code Examples and Technical Implementations](30_appendix_code_examples.md) contains complete, working code samples referenced throughout the chapters. These implementations demonstrate the concepts in practical, executable form—from Infrastructure Platform Team blueprints to competency frameworks, configuration templates, and automation scripts.

[Appendix B: Technical Architecture for Book Production](31_technical_architecture.md) documents the infrastructure and automation used to produce this book itself. This meta-example demonstrates Architecture as Code principles applied to documentation delivery, showing how the same practices scale from infrastructure to content pipelines.

The [Architecture as Code Maturity Model](architecture_as_code_maturity_model.md) consolidates insights from across the manuscript into a staircase-style progression model. It summarises how infrastructure, governance, policy, testing, and cultural practices evolve together when organisations embrace Architecture as Code.

The [Templates and Tools appendix](appendix_templates_and_tools.md) aggregates reusable artefacts—such as the maturity model, governance accelerators, and automation starters—so that teams can adopt proven scaffolding rather than beginning from scratch.

The [Control Mapping Matrix Template](appendix_c_control_mapping_matrix_template.md) offers a reusable table structure that underpins the "assure once, comply many" approach. It documents how evidence artefacts map to ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST 800-53, GDPR, and internal catalogues so that teams maintain a single source of truth for compliance coverage.

**What you will find in this section:**

- Comprehensive glossary of Architecture as Code terminology
- Author background and expertise context
- Complete code examples and technical implementations
- Book production infrastructure as a working Architecture as Code example
- Templates and tools that accelerate adoption and compliance workflows
- A maturity model that ties the “as code” disciplines together with practical adoption guidance

These references serve as quick-access resources to support the concepts explored in Parts A through G, ensuring that theoretical understanding translates into practical implementation.
