# Documentation Bot Responses

This directory stores outlines generated by the `editor_bot.py` automation.
Whenever an issue is labeled with `documentation`, the corresponding workflow
creates a documentation response file that guides content creation and review.
Files follow the pattern `ISSUEID-slug.md` and can be refined into actionable
updates.
