# Version Control and Code Structure

Effective version control forms the backbone of Architecture as Code implementations. Applying the same practices as software development to infrastructure definitions delivers traceability, collaboration opportunities, and quality control.

The diagram illustrates the typical flow from a Git repository through branching strategy and code review to final deployment, ensuring controlled and traceable infrastructure development.

## Git-based workflow for infrastructure

Git is the standard for version control of Architecture as Code assets and enables distributed collaboration between team members. Each change is documented with commit messages that describe what was modified and why, creating a complete history of infrastructure evolution.

## Code organisation and module structure

A well-organised code structure is crucial for maintainability and collaboration in larger Architecture as Code projects. Modular design enables the reuse of infrastructure components across different projects and environments.
