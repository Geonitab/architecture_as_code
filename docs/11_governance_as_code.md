# Governance as Code

## Overview

Governance as Code extends the principles of Infrastructure as Code to the policies, approval flows, and organizational guardrails that keep architecture and delivery aligned with strategic intent. By expressing governance artifacts in version-controlled repositories, teams gain transparency, traceability, and automation opportunities whilst still respecting compliance and risk requirements.

Figure 11.1 illustrates the complete governance approval workflow, demonstrating how policy changes flow from initial authoring through automated validation, human review, and finally into production enforcement. The sequence diagram shows the interaction between policy authors, the Git repository, CI/CD automation, governance reviewers, and production controls. This end-to-end view reveals how automation and human oversight combine to create a robust governance lifecycle that is both rigorous and efficient.

The workflow begins when a policy author drafts a governance update and commits it to the repository. Automated CI/CD checks immediately validate the update through schema validation, security policy checks, compliance verification, and policy simulation tests. These automated controls catch common errors early, reducing the burden on human reviewers whilst ensuring baseline quality standards. Only after passing these automated checks does the change proceed to human governance reviewers, who examine the policy in context, provide feedback, and ultimately approve the merge. Once approved, the policy automatically promotes to production controls, generating an audit trail that documents the entire approval process.

## Implementing Approval Processes with Pull Requests

Modern governance workflows can leverage pull requests as sophisticated approval gates that mirror software development practices whilst preserving the rigour required for policy management. By designing dedicated branching strategies for governance artifacts, organisations maintain distinct branches for policy drafts, review cycles, and production-ready governance definitions. This approach mirrors software development workflows and keeps governance states explicit, making it clear which policies are under active development and which have been approved for enforcement.

Pull requests serve as natural approval gates in this workflow, requiring reviews from architecture leads, security officers, and business stakeholders before merging changes to governance code. Pull-request templates can capture mandatory information such as risk assessments, policy mappings, and rollout plans, ensuring that every governance change follows a consistent approval process. This structured approach transforms abstract approval processes into concrete, auditable repository events.

Automated checks integrated into CI pipelines validate governance definitions using policy-as-code tools, schema validations, and automated tests that ensure guardrails remain intact. Only merges that pass both automated checks and human approvals reach the main branch, creating a safety net that prevents misconfigurations whilst accelerating review cycles. Repository features such as GitHub environments and branch protection can be configured to enforce mandatory status checks, signed commits, and review requirements, embedding governance controls directly within the repository infrastructure.

The integration extends to documentation and traceability. Linking pull requests to Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) captures the rationale, business impact, and audit trails in a single system of record. This creates a comprehensive governance history where every policy change is associated with its context, approvers, and supporting evidence, satisfying both operational needs and compliance requirements.

## Navigating Competency Gaps During Transition

The transition to Governance as Code often surfaces competency gaps that must be addressed systematically to ensure successful adoption. Beginning with a thorough mapping of existing responsibilities to governance roles helps identify which stakeholders currently approve policies, manage risk, or oversee compliance. These responsibilities then translate into code ownership and review rights within the repository structure, preserving accountability whilst modernising the workflow.

Targeted training investments prove essential for helping traditional governance professionals adapt to code-centric workflows. Workshops covering Git fundamentals, pull-request etiquette, policy-as-code tooling, and secure coding practices provide the foundation that non-technical stakeholders need to participate confidently. This formal education can be complemented by pairing and mentoring structures that combine governance experts with experienced developers or platform engineers. These collaborative relationships allow teams to co-author governance artifacts, transferring technical knowledge whilst maintaining policy fidelity and domain expertise.

A staged transition strategy minimises risk and builds organisational confidence. Starting with low-risk governance components allows teams to gather feedback and refine their processes before expanding to more critical controls. Regular retrospectives capture lessons learned and inform adjustments to enablement plans, creating a learning cycle that improves outcomes over time. Throughout this transition, communicating new value streams becomes crucial—highlighting faster approval cycles, improved auditability, and better collaboration helps secure stakeholder buy-in and mitigates resistance stemming from the competency gap.

## Tooling to Enable Non-Developers

Successfully integrating non-technical stakeholders into Governance as Code workflows requires thoughtful tooling that reduces barriers whilst preserving the benefits of version-controlled policy management. Low-code policy editors provide graphical interfaces that generate policy code—such as Rego or Sentinel—allowing policy specialists to define rules without manually writing complex syntax. These tools abstract away technical details whilst ensuring the output conforms to required standards and integrates seamlessly with the repository.

Template-driven pull requests further lower the barrier to entry by supplying structured templates and form-based inputs that convert stakeholder submissions into well-formed governance updates. This approach guides contributors through the necessary information whilst maintaining consistency across submissions. Complementing these authoring tools, documentation-as-code portals publish rendered documentation from the repository to user-friendly portals or knowledge bases. These portals allow non-technical stakeholders to review governance changes through familiar interfaces without needing to read raw code files.

Communication platforms can be integrated through ChatOps capabilities, connecting collaboration tools such as Microsoft Teams or Slack to repository workflows. These integrations enable users to trigger governance checks, receive review notifications, and approve changes from familiar interfaces, meeting stakeholders where they already work. Automated policy explainers add another layer of accessibility by translating policy code into natural language summaries. This reduces dependency on programming skills whilst preserving the authoritative source in code, ensuring that governance artifacts remain machine-readable and automatically enforceable even as they become human-readable through these translation layers.

## Key Takeaways

Governance as Code modernizes policy management by placing guardrails alongside the systems they protect. Using pull requests to orchestrate approvals strengthens auditability and responsiveness, while deliberate enablement, training, and supportive tooling ensure that governance professionals can thrive in a code-based ecosystem.
