# Diagram Asset Guidelines

- Store Mermaid source diagrams as `.mmd` files in this directory.
- Do not commit generated `.png` outputs; the publishing workflow renders images from the Mermaid sources.
- If a PNG is missing locally, run the CI workflow or the provided build scripts to regenerate assets as part of the publishing pipeline.
