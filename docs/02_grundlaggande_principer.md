# Fundamental Principles of Architecture as Code

Architecture as Code builds on fundamental principles that ensure successful implementation of codified system architecture. These principles encompass the entire system landscape and create a holistic view of architecture management.

![Fundamental principles diagram](images/diagram_02_kapitel1.png)

Diagram shows the natural flow from declarative code through version control and automation to reproducibility and scalability - the five fundamental pillars within Architecture as Code.

## Declarative architecture definition

The declarative approach in Architecture as Code means describing the desired system state at all levels - from application components to infrastructure. This differs from imperative programming where each step must be specified explicitly.

Declarative definition enables describing architecture's desired state, that Architecture as Code extends to encompass application architecture, API-contracts and organizational structures.

## Holistic perspective on codification

Architecture as Code encompasses the entire system ecosystem through a holistic approach. This includes application logic, data flows, security policies, compliance-rules and organizational structures.

A practical example is how a change in an application's API automatically can propagate through the entire architecture - from security configurations to documentation - all of which is defined as code.

## immutable architecture patterns

The principle of immutable architecture means the entire system architecture is managed through immutable components. instead of modifying existing parts, new versions are created that replace old ones at all levels.

This creates predictability and eliminates architectural drift - where systems gradually diverge from their intended design over time.

## Testability at architecture level

Architecture as Code enables testing of entire system architecture, not only individual components. This includes validation of architecture patterns, compliance with design principles and verification of end-to-end flows.

Architecture tests validate design decisions, system complexity and ensures the entire architecture functions as intended.

## Documentation as Code

Documentation as Code (DaC) represents the principle of treating documentation as an integrated part of codebase rather than as a separate artifact. This means that documentation is stored together with the code, version-controlled using the same tools and undergoes the same quality assurance processes as the application code.

### Benefits with Documentation as Code

**version control and history**: by storing documentation in Git or other version control systems organizations get automatic traceability of changes, ability to restore previous versions and full history of documentation's development.

**Collaboration and review**: Pull requests and merge-processes ensures documentation changes are reviewed before being published. This improves quality and reduces the risk of incorrect or outdated information.

**CI/CD integration**: Automated pipelines can generate, validate and publish documentation automatically when code changes. This eliminates manual steps and ensures the documentation is always up-to-date.

### Practical implementation

```yaml
# .github/workflows/docs.yml
name: Documentation Build and Deploy
on:
  push:
    paths: ['docs/**', 'README.md']
  pull_request:
    paths: ['docs/**']

jobs:
  build-docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
        
      - name: Generate documentation
        run: |
          npm run docs:build
          npm run docs:lint
          
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./docs/dist
```

Moderna verktyg that GitBook, Gitiles and MkDocs enables automatisk generering of webbdokumentation from Markdown-filer lagrade tosammans with the code.

## Requirements as Code

Requirements as Code (RaC) transformerar traditionell kravspecifikation from textdokument to maskinl채sbar code as can exekveras, valideras and automatiseras. This paradigmskifte enables kontinuerlig verification of to systemet uppfyller sina krav through entire utvecklingslivscykeln.

### automation and traceability

**Automatiserad validation**: Krav uttryckta as code can exekveras automatically mot systemet to verifiera compliance. This eliminates manuell testing and ensures konsekvent validation.

**Direkt koppling between krav and code**: each systemkomponent can kopplas tobaka to specifika krav, which creates fullst채ndig traceability from aff채rsbehov to Technical implementation.

**Continuous compliance**: Changes in systemet valideras automatically mot all definierade krav, which forhindrar regression and ensures ongoing compliance.

### practical example with Open Policy Agent (OPA)

```yaml
# requirements/security-requirements.yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: RequirementSet
metadata:
  name: svenska-sakerhetskrav
  version: "1.2"
spec:
  requirements:
    - id: SEC-001
      type: security
      description: "all S3 buckets must ha kryptering aktiverad"
      priority: critical
      compliance: ["GDPR", "ISO27001"]
      policy: |
        package security.s3_encryption
        
        deny[msg] {
          input.resource_type == "aws_s3_bucket"
          not input.server_side_encryption_configuration
          msg := "S3 bucket must ha server-side encryption"
        }
    
    - id: GDPR-001
      type: compliance  
      description: "Persondata must lagras within EU/EES"
      priority: critical
      compliance: ["GDPR"]
      policy: |
        package compliance.data_residency
        
        deny[msg] {
          input.resource_type == "aws_rds_instance"
          not contains(input.availability_zone, "eu-")
          msg := "RDS instans must placeras in EU-region"
        }
```

### validation and test-automation

Requirements as Code integreras naturligt with test-automation by krav blir executable specifications:

```python
# test/requirements_validation.py
import yaml
import opa

class RequirementsValidator:
    def __init__(self, requirements_file: str):
        with open(requirements_file, 'r') as f:
            self.requirements = yaml.safe_load(f)
    
    def validate_requirement(self, req_id: str, system_config: dict):
        requirement = self.find_requirement(req_id)
        policy_result = opa.evaluate(
            requirement['policy'], 
            system_config
        )
        return {
            'requirement_id': req_id,
            'status': 'passed' if not policy_result else 'failed',
            'violations': policy_result
        }
    
    def validate_all_requirements(self) -> dict:
        results = []
        for req in self.requirements['spec']['requirements']:
            result = self.validate_requirement(req['id'], self.system_config)
            results.append(result)
        
        return {
            'total_requirements': len(self.requirements['spec']['requirements']),
            'passed': len([r for r in results if r['status'] == 'passed']),
            'failed': len([r for r in results if r['status'] == 'failed']),
            'details': results
        }
```
