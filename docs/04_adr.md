# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

![ADR Process Flow](images/diagram_04_adr_process.png)

*Architecture Decision Records represents a structured method for documenting important architecture decisions within code-based systems. The process begins with problem identification and follows a systematic approach to analyze context, evaluate alternatives and formulate well-founded decisions.*

## Overall Description

Architecture as Code methodology forms the foundation for Architecture Decision Records (ADR) which forms a systematic approach for documenting important architecture decisions that affects the system structure, performance, security and maintainability. ADR method was introduced by Michael Nygard and has become an established best practice in modern system development.

For organizations implementing Architecture as Code, ADR is particularly valuable because it ensures architecture decisions are documented in a structured manner that meets compliance requirements and facilitates knowledge transfer between teams and over time.

ADR functions as architecture's "commit messages" - short, focused documents that capture context (context), problem, the chosen alternative and consequences of important architecture decisions. This enables traceability and understanding for why specific technical choices were made.

Modern digitalization strategies emphasize the importance of transparent and traceable decisions within the public sector. ADR method supports these requirements by creating an audit trail of architecture decisions that can be reviewed and evaluated over time.

## What is Architecture Decision Records?

Architecture Decision Records are defined as short text documents that capture important architecture decisions together with their context and consequences. each ADR describes a specific decision, problem it solves, alternatives that were considered and rationale behind the chosen alternative.

The ADR format follows typically a Structured template that includes:

**Status**: Current status for decision (proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded)
**Context**: Background and circumstances that led to the need for decision
**Decision**: the specific decision that was made
**Consequences**: Expected positive and negative consequences

Official guidelines and templates are available at https://adr.github.io, which serves as the primary resource for ADR methodology. This website is maintained by the ADR community and contains standardized templates, tools and examples.

In the Architecture as Code context means ADR documentation of decisions about technology choices, architecture patterns, security strategies and operational policies that are codified in architecture definitions.

## Structure and Components of ADR

![ADR structure](images/diagram_04_adr_struktur.png)

*each ADR follows a standardiserad structure with four huvudkomponenter that ensure konsekvent and complete documentation of architecture decisions.*

### Standardiserad ADR-template

each ADR follows a konsekvent structure that ensure all relevant information fångas systematiskt:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Short Description of decision]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
Description of problem as needs lösas and the circumstances
that led to the need for this decisions.

## Decision
the specific decision that was made, including technical details
and architecture as code-implementation approach.

## Consequences
### Positiva consequences
- Förväntade fördelar and förbättringar

### Negativa consequences
- Identifierade risker and begränsningar

### Mitigering
- Åtgärder to handle negative consequences
```

### Numrering and versionering

ADR numreras sekventiellt (ADR-0001, ADR-0002, etc.) to create a kronologisk ordning and enkel referens. Numreringen is permanent - also about A ADR depreceras or is replaced behålls originalets nummer.

Versionering is managed through Git-history instead for inline-changes. about A decisions forändras are created A nytt ADR as superseder the ursprungliga, which bevarar The historiska contexten.

### Status lifecycle

![ADR Lifecycle](images/diagram_04_adr_lifecycle.png)

*ADR-livscykeln illustrerar how decisions is developed from initialt forslag through granskningsprocessen to Architecture as Code-implementation, monitoring and eventuell avveckling when new solutions is needed.*

ADR undergoes typically following statusar:

**Foreslagen**: Initialt forslag as undergoes granskning and diskussion
**Accepted**: Godkänt decisions as should implementeras
**Deprecated**: Beslut as not längre rekommentheir but can finnas kvar in systems
**Superseded**: Ersatt of A nyare ADR with referens to ersättaren

## Praktiska example at ADR

### examples 1: Val of architecture as code tool

Architecture as Code-principerna within This area

```markdown
# ADR-0003: Val of Terraform for architecture as code

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Organisationen needs standardisera at A architecture as code tool
to handle AWS and Azure-environments. Nuvarande manual processes
creates inconsistens and operational risker.

## Decision
We will use Terraform as primary architecture as code tool for all
cloud-environments, with HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) as
standardsyntax.

## Consequences

### Positiva consequences
- Multi-cloud support for AWS and Azure
- Stor community and comprehensive provider-ekosystem
- Declarative syntax as matchar våra policy-requirements
- State management for traceability

### Negativa consequences
- Inlärningskurva for team as is vana at imperative scripting
- State file management komplexitet
- Kostnad for Terraform Cloud or Enterprise features

### Mitigering
- training programs for development teams
- implementation of Terraform remote state with Azure Storage
- Pilotprojekt before complete utrullning
```

### Example 2: Security Architecture Implementation

```markdown
# ADR-0007: Zero Trust Network Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
GDPR and MSB:s guidelines for cybersäkerhet requires robust security measures.
Traditionell perimeter-baserad security is otillräcklig for modern
hybrid cloud-environment.

## Decision
implementation of Zero Trust Network Architecture with mikrosegmentering,
multi-factor authentication and continuous verification through
architecture as code.

## Consequences

### Positiva consequences
- Förbättrad compliance of security requirements
- Reducerad attack surface through mikrosegmentering
- Förbättrad auditbarhet and traceability

### Negativa consequences
- Ökad komplexitet in nätverksarkitektur
- Prestationsöverhuvud for continuous verification
- Högre operational kostnader

### Mitigering
- Fasad implementation with pilot-projekt
- Prestandaövervakning and optimering
- Extensive documentation and training
```

## Tools and best methods for ADR within architecture as code

### ADR-tools and integration

Flera tools facilitates creation and management of ADR:

**adr tool**: Kommandoradsverktyg to create and handle ADR-filer
**adr-log**: Automatisk generering of ADR-index and tidslinje
**Architecture Decision Record plugins**: Integration with IDE:er that VS Code

For Architecture as Code-projekt rekommentheir integration of ADR in Git repository structure:

```
docs/
├── adr/
│   ├── 0001-record-architecture-decisions.md
│   ├── 0002-use-terraform-for-architecture as code.md
│   └── 0003-implement-zero-trust.md
├── infrastructure/
└── README.md
```

### Git-integration and arbetsflöde

ADR functions optimalt when integrerat in Git-baserade utvecklingsarbetsflöden:

**Kodgranskningar**: ADR inklutheir in kodgranskningsprocessen for architecture changes
**Branch Protection**: requires ADR for major architectural changes
**automation**: CI/CD-pipelines can validate to relevant ADR exist for significant changes

### Quality Standards for Compliance

To meet compliance requirements, ADR should follow specific quality standards:

**Language**: ADR should be written in English for consistency and tool compatibility
**Traceability**: Clear linking between ADR and implemented code
**Access**: Transparent access for auditors and compliance officers
**Retention**: Long-term archiving according to organizational policies

### Gransknings- and styrningsprocess

Effective ADR-implementation requires etablerade granskningsprocesser:

**Intressentengagemang**: Relevanta team and arkitekter involveras in granskning
**Tidslinje**: Definierade tidsgränser for återkoppling and decisions
**Escalation**: Tydliga eskaleringsvägar for disputed decisions
**Approval Authority**: Dokumenterade roller for different typer of architecture decisions

## Integration with Architecture as Code

ADR spelar a central roll in Architecture as Code-metodik by document design decisions that are then implemented as code. This integration creates a clear link between intentioner and implementation.

Architecture as Code-templates can referera to relevant ADR to forklara design decisions and implementation choices. This creates självdocumentserande infrastructure where the code kompletteras with arkitekturrational.

Automated validation can implementeras to ensure to infrastructure code follows established ADR. Policy as Code tool that Open Policy Agent can enforça arkitekturguidelines baserade at documented decisions in ADR.

For organizations, this integration enables transparent governance and compliance where architecture decisions can be tracked from initial documentation through implementation to operational deployment.

## Compliance and kvalitetsstandarder

ADR-metodik supports compliance requirements through Structured documentation as enables:

**Regleringsefterlevnad**: Systematisk documentation for GDPR, PCI-DSS and branschspecific regulations
**Audit Readiness**: Komplett spår of architecture decisions and their rationale
**Risk Management**: Dokumenterade riskbedömningar and mitigation strategies
**Knowledge Management**: Structured knowledge transfer between team and over time

Public sector organizations can use ADR to meet transparency requirements and democratic oversight in technical decisions that affect citizen services and data handling.

## Framtida development and trends

ADR-metodik is developed kontinuerligt with integration of new tools and processes:

**AI-assisterade ADR**: Machine learning to identify when new ADR is needed based on code changes
**Automated Decision Tracking**: Integration with architectural analysis tools
**Organisationsövergripande ADR-delning**: Standardiserade format for delning of anonymiserade architecture patterns

In the Architecture as Code context is developed tools for automatic korrelation between ADR and driftsatt infrastructure, which enables realtidsvalidering of arkitektonisk compliance.

Organizations can benefit from international initiatives for standardization of digital documentation practices that build on ADR methodology for increased interoperability and compliance.

## Summary


The modern Architecture as Code methodology represents the future of infrastructure management for organizations worldwide.
Architecture Decision Records represent a fundamental component in modern Architecture as Code methodology. Through structured documentation of architecture decisions, transparency, traceability and knowledge transfer are created which are critical for digital transformation initiatives.

Effective ADR implementation requires organizational support, standardized processes and integration with existing development workflows. For Architecture as Code projects, ADR enables the connection between design intentions and code implementation that improves maintainability and compliance.

Organizations that adopt ADR methodology position themselves for successful Architecture as Code transformation with robust governance processes and transparent decision documentation that supports both internal requirements and external compliance expectations.
