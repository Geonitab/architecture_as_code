# GitHub Actions Failure Analysis: Run 18386920895

## Incident Overview
- **Run URL:** [18386920895](https://github.com/Geonitab/architecture_as_code/actions/runs/18386920895)
- **Trigger:** Pull request `codex/fix-errors-in-build_book.sh`
- **Failed Jobs:** "üöÄ Traditional Complete Build" and "üê≥ Docker Optimized Build"
- **Failing Step:** `docs/build_book.sh --release` (invoked via `build_release.sh`)

## Impact
- Unified release workflow stopped before producing EPUB and DOCX assets.
- Both jobs reported a `failure` conclusion, preventing the PR from merging automatically.

## Technical Findings
### Failing Step Details
`docs/build_book.sh` prepares a chapter manifest that now includes every part marker (`docs/part_*.md`) before running Pandoc for all formats.„ÄêF:docs/build_book.sh‚Ä†L235-L275„Äë Each marker contains LaTeX-only commands (`\part{...}`, `\setbookpart{...}`) intended for the PDF output.„ÄêF:docs/part_a_foundations.md‚Ä†L1-L3„Äë

When the script proceeds to `generate_other_formats()` it reuses the same manifest for EPUB and DOCX conversions. Pandoc cannot parse the raw LaTeX in those formats, causing the EPUB command to exit non-zero. The script bubbles up the failure (`return 1`), which stops both CI jobs.„ÄêF:docs/build_book.sh‚Ä†L368-L408„Äë

### Comparison with Run 18359280640
Run [18359280640](https://github.com/Geonitab/architecture_as_code/actions/runs/18359280640) built commit `97bd9861a457c019d0fd5770e1f697670a7ae0a1` on `main` and succeeded.„Äêfd63a4‚Ä†L1-L7„Äë That revision of `docs/build_book.sh` did not add the part marker files to the shared manifest, so EPUB/DOCX steps never encountered the LaTeX directives and the workflow completed successfully.

## Remediation Plan
1. **Short-term:** Skip or sanitize the part marker files when generating non-LaTeX formats to restore EPUB/DOCX builds while keeping the improved PDF structure.
2. **Long-term:** Add automated coverage (unit test or smoke step) to ensure future modifications to `CHAPTER_FILES` do not reintroduce incompatible content for alternate targets.

## Validation Strategy
- After updating `docs/build_book.sh`, rerun `python3 generate_book.py && docs/build_book.sh --release` locally or in CI to confirm all formats succeed.
- Monitor subsequent GitHub Actions runs for both PRs and `main` pushes to ensure no regression.
