## Swedish Terminology Reference

> **Terminology Note:** The Swedish organisations and institutions referenced here keep their native names to preserve accuracy. The translations below clarify the meaning for readers unfamiliar with Swedish terminology.

- **Kvadrat AB** – `AB` stands for *aktiebolag*, Sweden’s equivalent of a limited company. The firm’s name translates literally to “square” but is always written as Kvadrat in branding.
- **KTH Royal Institute of Technology** – Commonly referred to as KTH, the Swedish name is *Kungliga Tekniska högskolan* (“Royal Institute of Technology”).
- **Linköping University** – In Swedish, *Linköpings universitet*; the apostrophe-free form follows Swedish grammar rules.
- **Malmö University** – *Malmö universitet* retains the letter `ö`, pronounced roughly like the vowel sound in “blur”.
- **Nordqvist** – A Swedish family name combining *nord* (“north”) and *qvist* (“twig”), reflecting traditional Swedish surname construction.

## Closing Reflections

The journey towards Architecture as Code represents more than a technical evolution—it embodies a fundamental shift in how we conceive, design, and operate technology systems. By codifying architecture, we bring the rigour, repeatability, and reliability of software engineering to the entire technology landscape.

This book aims to accelerate the adoption of Architecture as Code principles and contribute to improved technical outcomes across organisations. The success of these methodologies depends not only on technical implementation but on cultural transformation and organisational commitment to treating architecture as a first-class engineering discipline.

As technology continues to evolve, the principles outlined in this book—declarative design, version control, automation, and continuous validation—will remain fundamental to building reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems.
