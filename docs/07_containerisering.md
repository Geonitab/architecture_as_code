# Containerization and Orchestration as code

![Containerization and Orchestration](images/diagram_11_kapitel10.png)

Architecture as Code-metodiken utgör grunden for containerteknologi and orkestrering representerar paradigmskifte in how applikationer driftsätts and skalas. by definiera Architecture as Code for containrar möjliggörs portabel, skalbar and reproducerbar applikationsdriftsättning over olika miljöer and molnleverantörer.

## Container-teknologiens roll within architecture as code

Containers erbjuder application-level virtualization as paketerar applikationer with all dependencies in isolated, portable units. For Architecture as Code means This to application deployment can standardiseras and automatiseras through code-based definitions as ensures consistency mellan development, testing and production environments.

Docker har etablerat itself as the facto standard for containerization, withan podman and andra alternativ erbjuder daemon-less approaches for enhanced security. Container images definieras through Dockerfiles as executable infrastructure code, which enables version control and automated building of application artifacts.

Container registries fungerar as centralized repositories for image distribution and versioning. Private registries ensures corporate security requirements, withan image scanning and vulnerability assessment integreras in CI/CD pipelines for automated security validation innan deployment.

## Kubernetes as orchestration platform

Kubernetes har emergerat as leading container orchestration platform through dess declarative configuration model and extensive ecosystem. YAML-based manifests definierar desired state for applications, services, and infrastructure components, which alignar perfekt with Architecture as Code principles.

Kubernetes objects that Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets enables comprehensive application lifecycle management through code. Pod specifications, resource quotas, network policies, and persistent volume claims can all definieras declaratively and managed through version control systems.

Helm charts extend Kubernetes capabilities through templating and package management for complex applications. Chart repositories enable reusable infrastructure patterns and standardized deployment procedures across different environments and organizational units.

## Service mesh and advanced networking

Service mesh architectures that Istio and Linkerd implementeras through Infrastructure as Code to hantera inter-service communication, security policies, and observability. These platforms abstract networking complexity from application developers while providing fine-grained control through configuration files.

Traffic management policies definieras as code for load balancing, circuit breaking, retry mechanisms, and canary deployments. Security policies for mutual TLS, access control, and authentication/authorization can be version controlled and automatically applied across service topologies.

Observability configurations for tracing, metrics collection, and logging integration managed through declarative specifications. This enables comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities while maintaining consistency across distributed service architectures.

## Infrastructure automation with container platforms

Architecture as Code-principerna within This område

Container-native infrastructure tools that Crossplane and Operator Framework extend Kubernetes for complete infrastructure management. These platforms enables provisioning and management of cloud resources through Kubernetes-native APIs and custom resource definitions.

GitOps workflows implement continuous delivery for both applications and infrastructure through Git repositories as single source of truth. Tools that ArgoCD and Flux automate deployment processes through continuous monitoring of Git state and automatic reconciliation of cluster state.

Multi-cluster management platforms centralize policy enforcement, resource allocation, and governance across distributed Kubernetes environments. Federation and cluster API specifications standardize cluster lifecycle management through declarative configurations.

## Persistent storage and data management

Persistent volume management for containerized applications requires careful consideration of performance, availability, and backup requirements. Storage classes and persistent volume claims definieras as infrastructure code for automated provisioning and lifecycle management.

Database operators for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and andra systems enable database-as-code deployment patterns. These operators handle complex operations as backup scheduling, high availability configuration, and automated recovery through custom resource definitions.

Data protection strategies implementeras through backup operators and disaster recovery procedures definierade as code. This ensures consistent data protection policies across environments and automated recovery capabilities during incidents.

          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: db-credentials
              key: url
