# Architecture as Code Documentation

Welcome to the Architecture as Code documentation portal. This site publishes the complete manuscript of the Architecture as Code book in a web-friendly format so you can explore the chapters, diagrams, and appendices directly in your browser. If you want to see the source code and files they are available in the repository at [GitHub](https://github.com/Geonitab/architecture_as_code/)

## How to Use This Site

- Start with the **Introduction** to understand the foundations of the Architecture as Code mindset.
- Navigate through each part to follow the narrative from principles and platform capabilities to governance, delivery, and organisational change.
- Visit the appendices for glossary terms, author biographies, and technical reference material that supports book production.

For an overview of the structure and rationale behind the book, read the [Book Structure](book_structure.md) page. When you are ready to dive into the content, continue to the first chapter: [Introduction to Architecture as Code](#chapter-introduction).
