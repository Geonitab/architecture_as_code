# Migration from Traditional Infrastructure

![Migration journey roadmap](images/diagram_18_kapitel16.png)

*The migration journey roadmap illustrates the phased progression from discovering the current estate to operating an Architecture as Code platform with embedded feedback loops.*

## Strategic Overview

Migrating from manually configured estates to Architecture as Code is one of the most consequential change initiatives for Swedish technology organisations. The transition replaces brittle hand-crafted infrastructure with software-defined platforms that deliver predictable change, continuous compliance, and transparent cost control. Success demands more than tooling: leadership must sponsor the programme, stakeholders require clear narratives about value, and delivery teams need time to modernise working practices.

Swedish enterprises also contend with distinctive regulatory expectations and a prevalence of hybrid estates that mix on-premises assets with Nordic data centres and global cloud regions. A migration approach therefore has to balance innovation with operational continuity, ensuring customer trust, public sector obligations, and sustainability targets remain intact.

## Assessment and Planning Foundations

A robust assessment provides the evidence base for every subsequent decision. Discovery activities catalogue infrastructure components, interdependencies, and compliance constraints across data classifications. Automated tooling such as AWS Application Discovery Service, Azure Migrate, and Google Cloud Migration Centre accelerates this work by producing importable descriptors for Architecture as Code templates.

Risk analysis must highlight critical services, single points of failure, licensing constraints, and legal considerations relevant to Swedish and EU regulations. Workshops with business units convert the raw inventory into migration waves that pair technical dependencies with value realisation. Pilot workloads—ideally customer-facing but low risk—allow the organisation to practise new deployment pipelines before touching mission-critical systems.

## Choosing the Right Migration Path

No single strategy fits every workload. A lift-and-shift move offers the fastest exit from data centres but leaves value unrealised until optimisation follows. Re-architecting enables resilient, scalable services and often pays dividends for fintech, retail, and public sector platforms that must handle seasonal surges or new digital channels. Many Swedish organisations adopt a “lift, improve, and evolve” pattern: stabilise the workload in the cloud, modernise high-value components, and decommission redundant services.

Portfolio analysis determines whether applications should be migrated, modernised, retired, or replaced with SaaS offerings. Documenting these decisions in Architecture as Code repositories and architectural decision records keeps stakeholders aligned and creates an auditable baseline for regulators.

## Progressive Codification of Infrastructure

Codifying infrastructure is not a one-time event. Teams import existing resources, then converge them towards standard modules that encode network boundaries, security guardrails, and logging expectations. Automated drift detection continuously compares live environments with repository definitions, while version control enables peer review and traceability.

Guardrails are vital during the transition. Introduce static analysis, policy-as-code, and cost monitoring before scaling migration waves. When discrepancies appear, iterate on templates and re-run validation checks rather than resorting to manual hotfixes. A single source of truth inside Git enables dependable rollbacks if an experiment underperforms.

## People, Process, and Operating Model

*The hybrid operating model combines cross-functional teams, shared landing zones, and governance rings that preserve compliance while encouraging experimentation.*

Architecture as Code adoption reshapes team boundaries. Legacy operations, networking, and security specialists join platform squads that own shared landing zones. Rotational mentorship and pair-programming sessions accelerate knowledge transfer, while continuous learning paths help engineers build confidence with Terraform, Pulumi, or CloudFormation.

Change management must accompany technical delivery. Communicating success metrics—such as deployment lead time reductions or audit findings resolved automatically—builds trust. Retain a hybrid operating model during early waves so that legacy change processes remain available as a safety net. Gradually retire manual gates as automated controls demonstrate reliability.

## Practical Toolkit for Swedish Teams

Chapter 16 references three reusable assets that live in the appendix:

- **Migration assessment accelerator** – See Appendix entry [16_CODE_1](30_appendix_code_examples.md#16_code_1-migration-assessment-accelerator) for a Python script that inventories unmanaged AWS resources, classifies complexity, and generates Terraform starter templates.
- **Legacy workload import template** – Appendix entry [16_CODE_2](30_appendix_code_examples.md#16_code_2-legacy-workload-import-template) contains a CloudFormation template that formalises existing VPC and EC2 resources without service disruption.
- **Migration validation harness** – Appendix entry [16_CODE_3](30_appendix_code_examples.md#16_code_3-migration-validation-harness) provides a Bash script that exercises pre-migration backups, Terraform plans, compliance checks, and performance baselines.

Integrating these artefacts into version-controlled repositories ensures every migration wave is repeatable, reviewable, and measurable.

## Summary

A successful migration from traditional infrastructure to Architecture as Code combines diligent assessment, tailored workload strategies, disciplined codification, and purposeful cultural evolution. Swedish organisations that embrace these practices gain shorter lead times, stronger compliance postures, and the confidence to experiment with new services. The accompanying diagrams and appendix assets provide practical scaffolding to keep the transformation on course.
