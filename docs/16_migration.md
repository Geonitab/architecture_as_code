![Migration process overview](images/diagram_18_kapitel16.png)

*Figure 16-1 illustrates the structured migration process from traditional infrastructure to Architecture as Code, encompassing assessment, planning, execution, and continuous optimisation phases. Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a systematic pathway to complete Architecture as Code adoption.*

## Overall Description

Migration from traditional, manually configured infrastructure to Architecture as Code represents one of the most critical transformations for modern IT organisations. This process requires not only technical restructuring but also organisational change and cultural adaptation to code-based ways of working.

Organisations face unique migration challenges stemming from legacy systems developed over decades, regulatory requirements that constrain the pace of change, and the need to balance innovation with operational stability. Successful migration requires comprehensive planning that minimises risks whilst enabling rapid value realisation.

Modern migration strategies must accommodate hybrid scenarios where legacy infrastructure coexists with Architecture as Code-managed resources during extended transition periods. This hybrid approach enables gradual migration that reduces business risk whilst delivering immediate benefits from Architecture as Code adoption.

Cloud-native migration pathways offer opportunities to modernise architecture whilst infrastructure management is codified. Organisations can leverage this transformation to implement sustainability initiatives, improve cost efficiency, and enhance security posture through systematic Architecture as Code adoption.

The migration journey demands careful orchestration of technical capabilities, organisational readiness, and cultural transformation. By following proven patterns and learning from industry best practices, organisations can navigate this transition whilst maintaining operational excellence and delivering continuous value to stakeholders.

## Assessment and Planning Phases

Comprehensive infrastructure assessment forms the foundation for successful Architecture as Code migration. This includes inventory of existing resources, dependency mapping, risk assessment, and cost-benefit analysis that informs migration strategy and timeline planning.

Discovery automation tools such as AWS Application Discovery Service, Azure Migrate, and Google Cloud migration tools can accelerate the assessment process through automated resource inventory and dependency detection. These tools generate data that can inform Architecture as Code template generation and migration prioritisation.

Risk assessment must identify critical systems, single points of failure, and compliance dependencies that affect migration approach. Financial institutions and healthcare organisations must particularly consider regulatory implications and downtime restrictions that affect migration windows and sequencing decisions.

Migration wave planning balances technical dependencies with business priorities to minimise risk and maximise value realisation. Pilot projects with non-critical systems enable team learning and process refinement before critical systems migration commences, creating a proven methodology that can be scaled across the organisation.

The assessment phase should produce a comprehensive inventory including all infrastructure components, their interdependencies, current costs, and performance baselines. This data becomes the foundation for informed decision-making throughout the migration journey and provides measurable benchmarks for success validation.

## Migration Strategy Selection

![Migration strategy comparison](images/diagram_16_migration_strategies.png)

*Figure 16-2 compares three primary migration approaches: lift-and-shift for speed, re-architecture for maximum value, and hybrid approaches that balance both objectives. Each strategy presents distinct trade-offs between investment, timeline, and long-term benefits.*

Lift-and-shift migration represents the fastest path to cloud adoption but limits potential benefits from cloud-native capabilities. This approach is suitable for applications with tight timelines or limited modernisation budgets, though it requires follow-up optimisation for long-term value realisation.

Re-architecture for cloud-native patterns enables maximum value from cloud investment through improved scalability, resilience, and cost optimisation. Leading organisations have demonstrated how re-architecture enables global expansion and innovation acceleration through cloud-native infrastructure, transforming both technical capabilities and business agility.

Hybrid approaches such as "lift-and-improve" balance speed-to-market with modernisation benefits through selective re-architecture of critical components whilst the majority of the application remains unchanged. This approach can deliver immediate cloud benefits whilst enabling iterative modernisation over time.

Application portfolio analysis helps determine the optimal migration strategy per application based on technical fit, business value, and modernisation potential. Legacy applications with limited business value may be candidates for retirement rather than migration, reducing overall migration scope and focusing resources on value-generating systems.

The strategy selection process should consider not only technical factors but also organisational readiness, budget constraints, compliance requirements, and business objectives. A well-balanced portfolio approach typically employs different strategies for different application tiers, optimising the overall migration programme for both speed and value.

## Gradual Infrastructure Codification

Infrastructure inventory automation through tools such as Terraform import, CloudFormation drift detection, and Azure Resource Manager templates enables systematic conversion of existing resources to Architecture as Code management. Automated discovery can generate initial Architecture as Code configurations that require refinement but significantly accelerate the codification process.

Template standardisation through reusable modules and organisational patterns ensures consistency across migrated infrastructure whilst reducing future maintenance overhead. Government agencies have successfully implemented standardised Architecture as Code templates for common infrastructure patterns across different departments, demonstrating the scalability of this approach.

Configuration drift elimination through Architecture as Code adoption requires systematic reconciliation between existing resource configurations and desired Architecture as Code state. Gradual enforcement of Architecture as Code-managed configuration ensures infrastructure stability whilst eliminating manual configuration inconsistencies that accumulate over time.

Version control integration for infrastructure changes enables systematic tracking of migration progress and provides rollback capabilities for problematic changes. Git-based workflows for infrastructure management establish the foundation for collaborative infrastructure development and operational transparency, essential for modern DevOps practices.

The codification process should prioritise resources based on business criticality, change frequency, and standardisation opportunities. Starting with non-critical, frequently changed resources allows teams to develop expertise whilst minimising risk, gradually expanding scope as confidence and capability increase.

## Team Transition and Competence Development

*Figure 16-3 depicts the transformation from traditional siloed teams to integrated DevOps teams practising Architecture as Code. The transition phase encompasses cross-training, tool adoption, process evolution, and cultural change, supported by mentorship and change management programmes.*

Skills development programmes must prepare traditional systems administrators and network engineers for Architecture as Code-based workflows. Training curricula should encompass Infrastructure as Code tools, cloud platforms, DevOps practices, and automation scripting for comprehensive capability development that addresses both technical and cultural dimensions.

Organisational structure evolution from traditional silos to cross-functional teams enables effective Architecture as Code adoption. Telecommunications companies have successfully transitioned from separate development and operations teams to integrated DevOps teams that manage architecture as code, demonstrating the viability of this transformation even in large, complex organisations.

Cultural transformation from manual processes to automated workflows requires change management programmes that address resistance and promote automation adoption. Success stories from early adopters can motivate broader organisational acceptance of Architecture as Code practices, creating momentum and demonstrating tangible benefits.

Mentorship programmes pairing experienced cloud engineers with traditional infrastructure teams accelerate knowledge transfer and reduce adoption friction. External consulting support can supplement internal capabilities during initial migration phases for complex enterprise environments, providing expertise whilst building internal competency.

The human dimension of migration often presents greater challenges than technical aspects. Investing in people through comprehensive training, mentoring, and change management not only ensures successful migration but also builds organisational capability for ongoing innovation and adaptation in an evolving technology landscape.

## Practical Implementation Examples

The migration journey requires robust automation and testing frameworks to ensure successful transitions. This section references comprehensive code examples that demonstrate key migration patterns and practices.

### Migration Assessment Automation

Infrastructure discovery and migration planning require automated assessment tools that can inventory existing resources, identify dependencies, and generate migration plans. A complete Python-based assessment framework is provided in [Appendix A, Section 16_CODE_1](30_appendix_code_examples.md#16_code_1), demonstrating:

- Automated discovery of unmanaged cloud resources
- Migration complexity assessment and effort estimation
- Terraform code generation for resource import
- Risk-based migration timeline creation
- Comprehensive migration playbook generation

The assessment automation framework provides methods for discovering EC2 instances, RDS databases, load balancers, and security groups that lack Infrastructure as Code management tags. It generates detailed migration plans with effort estimates, risk assessments, and wave-based timelines that balance technical dependencies with business priorities.

### CloudFormation Legacy Import

For organisations using AWS CloudFormation, importing existing resources into stack management requires careful configuration matching. A complete CloudFormation template for legacy resource import is available in [Appendix A, Section 16_CODE_2](30_appendix_code_examples.md#16_code_2), including:

- VPC and network resource import patterns
- EC2 instance import with proper tagging
- Security group configuration preservation
- Step-by-step import instructions and validation

The template demonstrates how to structure CloudFormation resources for import operations, ensuring that existing infrastructure state is preserved whilst bringing resources under Infrastructure as Code management. Proper tagging strategies ensure imported resources integrate seamlessly with existing governance frameworks.

### Migration Testing Framework

Comprehensive testing throughout the migration lifecycle validates that resources are correctly transitioned and continue functioning as expected. A complete bash-based testing framework is provided in [Appendix A, Section 16_CODE_3](30_appendix_code_examples.md#16_code_3), covering:

- Pre-migration infrastructure inventory and baseline establishment
- Backup verification and rollback readiness
- Terraform plan validation and safety checks
- Post-migration compliance and tagging validation
- Performance monitoring and anomaly detection

The testing framework implements multiple validation layers that execute before, during, and after migration. Pre-migration tests establish baselines and verify backup coverage. Migration execution tests validate Terraform plans and resource import procedures. Post-migration tests ensure compliance with organisational policies and monitor for performance regressions.

These practical examples provide production-ready code that organisations can adapt to their specific migration scenarios. The frameworks incorporate industry best practices for safety, compliance, and operational excellence whilst remaining flexible enough to accommodate diverse infrastructure environments and organisational requirements.

## Summary

Migration from traditional infrastructure to Architecture as Code represents a critical transformation that requires systematic planning, gradual implementation, and comprehensive testing. Organisations that successfully navigate this transition position themselves for increased agility, improved security, and significant cost benefits.

Success factors include comprehensive assessment, realistic timeline planning, extensive team training, and robust testing frameworks. Hybrid migration strategies enable risk minimisation whilst delivering immediate value from Architecture as Code adoption, creating a sustainable path forward that balances innovation with operational stability.

The three primary migration approaches—lift-and-shift, re-architecture, and hybrid strategies—each offer distinct advantages depending on organisational constraints and objectives. Selecting the appropriate strategy for each application based on technical fit, business value, and modernisation potential optimises overall programme outcomes.

Team transformation represents perhaps the most critical aspect of successful migration. Investing in comprehensive training, mentoring programmes, and change management ensures not only successful technical transition but also builds lasting organisational capability for ongoing innovation and adaptation in an evolving technology landscape.

Investment in proper migration planning and execution results in long-term benefits through improved operational efficiency, enhanced security posture, and reduced technical debt. Organisations that follow systematic migration approaches can expect successful transformation to modern, Architecture as Code-based infrastructure management that delivers sustained competitive advantage.
