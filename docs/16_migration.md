# Migration from Traditional Infrastructure

![Migration Process](images/diagram_18_kapitel16.png)

*Migration from traditional infrastructure to Architecture as Code requires systematic planning, phased implementation, and continuous validation. The diagram illustrates the structured process from initial assessment through to complete Architecture as Code adoption.*

## Overall Description

Migration from traditional, manually configured infrastructure to Architecture as Code represents one of the most critical transformations for modern IT organisations. This process requires not only technical restructuring but also organisational change and cultural adaptation to a code-based way of working.

Swedish organisations face unique migration challenges due to legacy systems that have developed over decades, regulatory requirements that constrain the pace of change, and the need to balance innovation with operational stability. Successful migration requires comprehensive planning that minimises risk whilst enabling rapid value realisation.

Modern migration strategies must accommodate hybrid scenarios where legacy infrastructure coexists with Architecture as Code-managed resources during extended transition periods. This hybrid approach enables gradual migration that reduces business risk whilst delivering immediate benefits from Architecture as Code adoption.

Cloud-native migration pathways offer opportunities to modernise architecture whilst infrastructure management is codified. Swedish companies can leverage this transformation to implement sustainability initiatives, improve cost efficiency, and enhance security posture through systematic Architecture as Code adoption.

## Assessment and Planning Phase

Comprehensive infrastructure assessment forms the foundation for successful Architecture as Code migration. This includes inventory of existing resources, dependency mapping, risk assessment, and cost-benefit analysis that informs migration strategy and timeline planning.

Discovery automation tools such as AWS Application Discovery Service, Azure Migrate, and Google Cloud migration tools can accelerate the assessment process through automated resource inventory and dependency detection. These tools generate data that can inform Architecture as Code template generation and migration prioritisation.

Risk assessment must identify critical systems, single points of failure, and compliance dependencies that affect the migration approach. Swedish financial institutions and healthcare organisations must particularly consider regulatory implications and downtime restrictions that affect migration windows.

Migration wave planning balances technical dependencies with business priorities to minimise risk and maximise value realisation. Pilot projects with non-critical systems enable team learning and process refinement before critical systems migration commences.

## Lift-and-Shift vs Re-architecting

Lift-and-shift migration represents the fastest way to cloud adoption but limits potential benefits from cloud-native capabilities. This approach is suitable for applications with tight timelines or limited modernisation budget, but requires follow-up optimisation for long-term value.

Re-architecting for cloud-native patterns enables maximum value from cloud investment through improved scalability, resilience, and cost optimisation. Swedish retail companies such as Klarna have demonstrated how re-architecting enables global expansion and innovation acceleration through cloud-native infrastructure.

Hybrid approaches such as "lift-and-improve" balance speed-to-market with modernisation benefits through selective re-architecting of critical components whilst the majority of the application remains unchanged. This approach can deliver immediate cloud benefits whilst enabling iterative modernisation.

Application portfolio analysis helps determine the optimal migration strategy per application based on technical fit, business value, and modernisation potential. Legacy applications with limited business value may be candidates for retirement rather than migration, which reduces overall migration scope.

## Gradual Infrastructure Codification

Infrastructure inventory automation through tools such as Terraform import, CloudFormation drift detection, and Azure Resource Manager templates enables systematic conversion of existing resources to Architecture as Code management. Automated discovery can generate initial Architecture as Code configurations that require refinement but accelerate the codification process.

Template standardisation through reusable modules and organisational patterns ensures consistency across migrated infrastructure whilst reducing future maintenance overhead. Swedish government agencies have successfully implemented standardised Architecture as Code templates for common infrastructure patterns across different departments.

Configuration drift elimination through Architecture as Code adoption requires systematic reconciliation between existing resource configurations and the desired Architecture as Code state. Gradual enforcement of Architecture as Code-managed configuration ensures infrastructure stability whilst eliminating manual configuration inconsistencies.

Version control integration for infrastructure changes enables systematic tracking of migration progress and provides rollback capabilities for problematic changes. Git-based workflows for infrastructure management establish a foundation for collaborative infrastructure development and operational transparency.

## Team Transition and Competence Development

Skills development programmes must prepare traditional systems administrators and network engineers for Architecture as Code-based workflows. Training curricula should encompass Infrastructure as Code tools, cloud platforms, DevOps practices, and automation scripting for comprehensive capability development.

Organisational structure evolution from traditional silos to cross-functional teams enables effective Architecture as Code adoption. Swedish telecommunications companies such as Telia have successfully transitioned from separate development and operations teams to integrated DevOps teams that manage architecture as code.

Cultural transformation from manual processes to automated workflows requires change management programmes that address resistance and promote automation adoption. Success stories from early adopters can motivate broader organisational acceptance of Architecture as Code practices.

Mentorship programmes pairing experienced cloud engineers with traditional infrastructure teams accelerate knowledge transfer and reduce adoption friction. External consulting support can supplement internal capabilities during initial migration phases for complex enterprise environments.

## Practical Implementation Examples

The migration from traditional infrastructure to Architecture as Code requires concrete implementation patterns and automation tools. This section provides an overview of key implementation approaches, with detailed code examples available in [Appendix A: Code Examples](30_appendix_code_examples.md#migration-automation).

### Migration Assessment Framework

A comprehensive assessment framework forms the cornerstone of successful migration. Automated discovery tools can inventory existing infrastructure, identify unmanaged resources, and generate initial Architecture as Code templates. The assessment process typically includes:

1. **Resource Discovery**: Automated scanning of cloud environments to identify all resources, both managed and unmanaged
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Analysis of resource relationships and dependencies to inform migration sequencing
3. **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluation of migration difficulty based on resource types, configurations, and interdependencies
4. **Risk Analysis**: Identification of high-risk components requiring special attention during migration

For a complete implementation of an automated infrastructure discovery and assessment tool, see [16_CODE_1: Migration Assessment Automation](30_appendix_code_examples.md#16_code_1) in the appendix.

### Infrastructure Import and Codification

Once resources are discovered, they must be systematically imported into Infrastructure as Code management. This process involves:

1. **Template Generation**: Creating initial Infrastructure as Code templates based on existing resource configurations
2. **Import Execution**: Using provider-specific import commands to bring resources under Infrastructure as Code control
3. **Configuration Validation**: Ensuring imported configurations match actual resource state to prevent unintended changes
4. **Tag Standardisation**: Applying consistent tagging to enable tracking and governance

CloudFormation provides native import capabilities for bringing existing resources under stack management. The appendix contains a complete example template demonstrating resource import patterns. See [16_CODE_2: CloudFormation Legacy Import](30_appendix_code_examples.md#16_code_2).

### Migration Testing and Validation

Robust testing frameworks are essential to validate migration success and ensure no degradation in service quality. A comprehensive testing approach includes:

1. **Pre-migration Baseline**: Capturing current state metrics and configurations
2. **Import Validation**: Verifying imported resources match expected configurations
3. **Compliance Verification**: Ensuring migrated resources meet organisational standards
4. **Performance Comparison**: Validating that performance characteristics remain acceptable

The testing framework should automate as much validation as possible to enable rapid iteration and reduce human error. A complete bash-based testing framework is provided in [16_CODE_3: Migration Testing Framework](30_appendix_code_examples.md#16_code_3).

### Migration Playbook Generation

Successful migrations require detailed planning and coordination. Automated playbook generation can create customised migration plans based on assessment results, including:

- Phased migration timelines with clear milestones
- Team training requirements and schedules
- Risk mitigation strategies for identified concerns
- Compliance checkpoints for regulatory requirements
- Success metrics and validation criteria

These playbooks provide structured guidance for migration teams whilst ensuring consistency across different migration waves.

## Summary

The modern Architecture as Code methodology represents the future for infrastructure management in Swedish organisations.

Migration from traditional infrastructure to Architecture as Code represents a critical transformation that requires systematic planning, gradual implementation, and comprehensive testing. Swedish organisations that successfully execute this migration position themselves for increased agility, improved security, and significant cost benefits.

Success factors include comprehensive assessment, realistic timeline planning, extensive team training, and robust testing frameworks. Hybrid migration strategies enable risk minimisation whilst delivering immediate value from Architecture as Code adoption.

Investment in proper migration planning and execution results in long-term benefits through improved operational efficiency, enhanced security posture, and reduced technical debt. Swedish organisations that follow systematic migration approaches can expect successful transformation to modern, Architecture as Code-based infrastructure management.
