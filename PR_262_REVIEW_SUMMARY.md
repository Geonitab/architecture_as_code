## Summary of Changes Made in PR #262

PR #262 successfully documented the relationship between issue templates and their corresponding pull requests by adding "Linked Pull Requests" sections to 11 issue template files. This provides traceability between:
- Issue templates (documentation of work to be done)
- Pull requests (implementation of the work)
- GitHub issues (tracking items for the work)

## Recommendations

1. **Update Open GitHub Issues**: The open issues listed above should be updated with comments referencing their linked PRs to maintain consistency between the issue templates and actual tracking issues.

2. **Review Completion Status**: For each open issue, verify whether the linked PRs have fully addressed all tasks and acceptance criteria. Issues should be closed if complete.

3. **Missing PR Links**: Two closed issues (#236, #238) don't have corresponding PR links in their template files. If PRs exist that resolved these issues, the template files should be updated.

4. **Automated Synchronization**: Consider implementing automation to keep issue templates and GitHub issues synchronized when PRs are merged.
