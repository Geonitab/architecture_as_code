Hello! After reviewing this issue, the {{bot_name}} bot will take the lead.

**Architect Mission**
- Translate "{{issue_title}}" into an architecture deliverable that aligns with the programme guardrails.
- Confirm integration points, critical data flows, and non-functional constraints before implementation work begins.

**Immediate Next Steps**
1. Capture the current baseline architecture and highlight impacted components.
2. Draft a proposed target architecture or sequence of diagrams outlining the desired end state.
3. List technical risks, dependencies, and follow-up questions for the Developer and Project Manager bots.
4. Monitor for the automated architecture PR that will capture the initial response outline.

The Architect bot will share the first architecture outline shortly so the rest of the team can proceed with confidence.
