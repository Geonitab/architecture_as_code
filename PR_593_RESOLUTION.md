# PR #593 Resolution Summary

## Issue Context
- **Original Issue**: #574 - "Localise Content to British English: Styling and Themes"
- **Pull Request**: #593 - Attempted to address issue #574
- **Status**: PR closed due to apparent attempt to make incorrect changes

## Analysis

### What Happened
1. Issue #574 requested conversion of American spelling "color" to British spelling "colour" in the "Styling and Themes" section of `docs/06_structurizr.md`
2. Commit **784a3d8** ("Adopt British English style for documentation") on 2025-10-15 already completed this conversion
3. PR #593 was created afterwards, but attempted to revert the changes (changing "colour" back to "color")
4. PR #593 was correctly closed as it would have undone the proper British English conversion

### Current State
All instances of color-related styling properties in `docs/06_structurizr.md` now use British spelling:
- ✅ All 16 instances use "colour" (British spelling)
- ✅ No instances of "color" (American spelling) remain
- ✅ Consistent with the project's STYLE_GUIDE.md requirement for British English

### Verification
```bash
# Search confirms no American spelling remains
grep -n "\bcolor\b" docs/06_structurizr.md
# Returns: (empty - only "colour" is used)

# All instances verified
grep -n "colour" docs/06_structurizr.md
# Returns: 16 instances, all using correct British spelling
```

## Resolution
**Issue #574 is RESOLVED** - The requested British English conversion was completed in commit 784a3d8. No further changes are needed.

## Recommendation
- Close issue #574 as resolved by commit 784a3d8
- No further action required for British English conversion in this file
- PR #593 was correctly closed as it attempted incorrect changes
